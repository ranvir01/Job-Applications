# Instructions for Finding Jobs

**Goal**: Find high-quality, relevant job postings with **direct application links** (no middleman sites like Indeed, LinkedIn, or recruiting agencies if possible).

## 1. Search Strategy
*   **Target Sites**: Search for the company's official career page first (e.g., `site:lever.co`, `site:greenhouse.io`, `site:myworkdayjobs.com` combined with the company name and "Seattle").
*   **Keywords**: Use specific terms like "Financial Analyst", "FP&A", "Finance Rotation", "Junior Finance", "Entry Level".
*   **Location**: "Seattle", "Remote", "Hybrid".
*   **Recency**: Always look for jobs posted in the last 30 days.

## 2. Filtering Criteria
*   **Experience**: strictly 0-3 years for "Entry Level" / "Junior" requests.
*   **Type**: Prioritize Full-time, but include Part-time/Contract if high quality.
*   **Direct Links Only**:
    *   ✅ GOOD: `careers.company.com`, `boards.greenhouse.io/...`, `jobs.lever.co/...`, `myworkdayjobs.com/...`
    *   ❌ BAD: `indeed.com`, `linkedin.com/jobs`, `ziprecruiter.com`, `recruiting-agency.com`
    *   *Exception*: If a government job (e.g., WSHFC), direct PDF or `.gov` links are required.

## 3. Output Format
Provide a clean list with:
1.  **Job Title**
2.  **Company**
3.  **Location/Type** (e.g., Seattle, Hybrid)
4.  **Why it's a fit** (One short sentence connecting to user's skills like SQL, Excel, or Finance degree)
5.  **Direct Link**: [Apply Here](url)

## 4. Verification
*   **Click-Test**: Verify the link works and goes to the specific job or the main career search page if the specific link is dynamic.
*   **No Dead Ends**: If a direct link isn't available, provide the Company Career Page URL instead of a broken deep link.
