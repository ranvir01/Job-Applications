## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this role?

> I'm drawn to this role because it combines my strengths in relationship management, data-driven goal-tracking, and stakeholder coordination—but applies them to something I actually care about. I grew up in a working-class family running a transportation business in Kent, WA. I saw firsthand how hard it is for regular people to get ahead, and how much policy actually matters when you're trying to make ends meet.
>
> The Finance Director role is about more than just raising money—it's about building the infrastructure to win elections and change who has power. I've spent the past few years managing client relationships, building CRM systems, setting targets, and making sure nothing falls through the cracks. Those are exactly the skills this job needs. The difference here is the mission actually means something to me.

### Why the Working Families Party?

> WFP isn't just another political organization—it's building something different. You're not just endorsing candidates, you're recruiting and training people who actually represent working-class communities. That's rare.
>
> I also respect that WFP is a union shop. That tells me you practice what you preach. Coming from a family business background, I know the difference between organizations that talk about workers and organizations that actually treat their own people right.
>
> The 2026 cycle is a big moment, and I want to be part of building the infrastructure that helps WFP win in New York. I bring the operational and relationship management skills to help hit ambitious fundraising goals—and I'm motivated by what those dollars actually fund.

### Walk me through your relevant experience

> I run an independent consulting practice where I manage relationships with multiple clients, set quarterly goals, and track performance against targets. One of my key achievements was building a Salesforce CRM system for a firm with 2,000+ contacts—organizing data, segmenting donors (or in that case, clients), and ensuring accurate follow-up. That's directly transferable to managing a donor database in EveryAction.
>
> Before that, I spent four years running operations for my family's transportation business. I managed a $1M+ annual operating budget, negotiated with vendors, and built the reporting systems from scratch. I learned how to juggle competing priorities, stay organized under pressure, and get things done when resources are tight.
>
> What I don't have is direct political fundraising experience—but I've got the core competencies: relationship cultivation, CRM management, goal-setting, stakeholder briefings, and the work ethic to put in evenings and weekends when it matters. I learn fast, and I'm motivated by the mission.

### Tell me about a time you managed multiple projects under pressure

> **Situation:** As an independent consultant, I was managing three client engagements simultaneously—one needed a business valuation, another needed CRM automation, and a third was a website redesign with a hard launch deadline.
>
> **Task:** I had to deliver high-quality work for all three without letting anything slip.
>
> **Action:** I built a personal tracking system in Notion to manage all tasks, deadlines, and follow-ups. I blocked time for each client and communicated proactively when priorities shifted. For the CRM project, I front-loaded the research phase so I could work on other things during the implementation. When the website deadline got moved up, I put in weekend hours to stay on track.
>
> **Result:** All three projects delivered on time. The CRM system I built is still running for 2,000+ accounts, the valuation helped my client understand their exit options, and the website launch increased leads by 25%. The key was staying organized and not pretending I could do everything at once.

### Tell me about a time you built a relationship that led to a result

> **Situation:** When I started consulting, I had to build my client base from scratch. One of my early prospects was skeptical—they'd worked with consultants before who overpromised and underdelivered.
>
> **Task:** I needed to build trust and demonstrate value before they'd commit to a larger engagement.
>
> **Action:** Instead of pitching a big project, I offered to do a focused analysis of one specific problem they had—their financial projections were all over the place. I spent a few hours building them a clean model, walked them through it on a call, and showed them where the gaps were. No charge for that first piece.
>
> **Result:** That turned into a full engagement where I delivered a business valuation and helped them understand their company was worth $1.45M-$1.75M. They've since referred me to two other clients. The lesson: start with genuine help, follow through on what you promise, and relationships compound over time.

### How do you stay organized and ensure follow-up?

> I'm obsessive about systems. I use a combination of Notion for project tracking and calendar blocks for focused work. Every client interaction gets logged—what we discussed, what I promised, and when the follow-up is due.
>
> For example, when I was managing the Salesforce CRM project, I set up automated reminders for follow-ups and created a dashboard showing pipeline status. Nothing fell through the cracks because the system wouldn't let it.
>
> In a fundraising context, I'd apply the same approach: call logs, pledge tracking, follow-up deadlines. The goal is never to be the person who drops the ball after a great donor meeting.

### What's your connection to the WFP mission?

> I grew up working-class. My family ran a trucking business in Kent, WA—long hours, tight margins, no safety net. I saw my parents navigate a system that wasn't built for people like us.
>
> That experience shaped how I think about politics. I don't think change comes from slick messaging or big donors alone—it comes from organizing working people and running candidates who actually represent them. That's what WFP does.
>
> I'm not coming to this job because I need any political job. I'm here because WFP's approach resonates with where I come from. Building power for the multiracial working class isn't an abstract idea to me—it's personal.
