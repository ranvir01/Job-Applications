# ❓ Application Questions: Integrated Dermatology FP&A Analyst

---

## 💬 Message to the Hiring Team

> I bring a unique perspective to this role—one that bridges finance and healthcare.
>
> I actually started my career path wanting to be a neurosurgeon. I was pursuing a biochemistry degree at UW, job-shadowing surgeons, and preparing for medical school. But toward the end, I realized what I really loved was problem-solving with numbers and patterns—skills that translate better to finance than the operating room. So I pivoted to the Foster School of Business and earned my degree in Finance.
>
> That medical background hasn't gone to waste. My girlfriend is a Medical Assistant at a dermatology clinic and is working toward becoming a PA. Through her, I've learned a lot about the business side of derm practices—patient flow, insurance billing complexities, how providers think about growth. I understand the operational realities your partner practices face daily.
>
> Professionally, I've spent 4+ years in FP&A roles. I managed budgeting and reporting for a transportation company, built VBA-automated dashboards that cut reporting time by 80%, and now consult for small businesses on financial modeling and valuations. One project helped grow a client's revenue from under $1M to over $3M through financial analysis and strategic recommendations.
>
> IDG's model—acquiring and partnering with dermatology practices nationally—combines my analytical skills with a healthcare context I genuinely understand. I'd bring both FP&A expertise and real appreciation for what your partner dermatologists are trying to build.
>
> I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to IDG's growth.

## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this FP&A Analyst role at Integrated Dermatology?

> A few things stand out:
>
> First, the core work. Budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, consolidated reporting—that's exactly what I've been doing for 4+ years. The JD reads like a description of my current skill set.
>
> Second, the growth environment. IDG acquires and partners with practices nationally. That means complex consolidation, integration analysis, and the kind of financial work that's intellectually engaging. I'd be involved in the growth story, not just maintaining the status quo.
>
> Third, the investor reporting component. I've prepared executive dashboards and board-ready presentations, but working with lenders and investors adds another dimension. I'm interested in that higher-stakes reporting.
>
> And the remote flexibility works perfectly for my situation in Seattle.

### Walk me through your FP&A experience

> I have about four years of hands-on FP&A experience:
>
> Currently, I'm an independent consultant doing financial strategy for multiple clients. My work includes budgeting, monthly forecasting, variance analysis, and consolidated reporting. I prepare executive dashboards, lead re-forecasting cycles, and communicate financial results to stakeholders clearly—in Excel, PowerPoint, and verbally.
>
> Before consulting, I spent four years as Business Manager for a transportation company. I owned a $1M+ annual operating budget across multiple departments. I did monthly P&L reporting, prepared detailed variance analysis versus budget and prior periods, and built KPI dashboards for leadership. I also automated our financial reporting using Excel VBA, cutting manual work by 80%.
>
> The common thread: full-cycle FP&A with a focus on clear communication and actionable insights.

### Tell me about your experience with budgeting and forecasting for multi-departmental organizations

> At Thind Transport, I managed budgets across operations, maintenance, and administrative functions. Each department had different drivers:
>
> - **Operations**: Revenue tied to routes and contracts; expenses driven by labor, fuel, and equipment
> - **Maintenance**: Largely fixed costs with variable components for repairs
> - **Admin**: Relatively stable, but I tracked trends and benchmarked against industry
>
> I built a consolidated budget that rolled up departmental forecasts, tracked actuals against plan monthly, and prepared variance analyses that explained what was driving differences.
>
> In my consulting work, I've continued this—working with clients across different business functions, understanding their specific drivers, and building forecasts that reflect operational reality.

---

### How do you approach variance analysis?

> I follow a structured approach:
>
> 1. **Calculate the variance**: Actual vs. budget, actual vs. prior period
> 2. **Break it down**: Is it volume? Price/rate? Timing? One-time items?
> 3. **Quantify**: Not just "revenue was up" but "$50K favorable due to X"
> 4. **Prioritize**: Focus on material variances—what moves the needle?
> 5. **Communicate clearly**: Lead with the headline, support with detail
>
> For example, at Thind Transport, if fuel costs spiked, I'd show: (1) the dollar variance, (2) how much was market price vs. consumption, (3) what we could do about it. The goal is actionable insight, not just explanation.

---

### Describe your Excel proficiency

> I'm advanced in Excel—it's my primary tool:
>
> - **VBA macros**: I've built automated reporting systems that reduced manual work by 80%
> - **Complex formulas**: VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, nested IFs, SUMIFS, array formulas
> - **Pivot Tables**: For slicing data by dimensions—period, department, account
> - **Data validation and error handling**: Building robust models that handle edge cases
> - **Dashboard design**: Clean, executive-ready layouts that tell a story
>
> I also know when Excel isn't the right tool and move to SQL or Python for heavier data work.

---

### How do you communicate complex financial results to non-finance stakeholders?

> I think about my audience first. Executives and operators don't need the same detail as the finance team.
>
> My approach:
> 1. **Lead with the headline**: "Revenue was up 5%, driven by X"
> 2. **Use visuals**: Charts > tables when possible
> 3. **Explain the "so what"**: What does this mean for decisions?
> 4. **Keep supporting detail available**: If they want to drill down, I have it
>
> For example, when presenting monthly financials, I start with a one-page summary: key metrics, notable variances, and recommended actions. The detailed analysis is in the appendix for those who want it.
>
> I also adapt format to audience—PowerPoint for presentations, Excel for finance partners, email summaries for quick updates.
