## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this Financial Analyst role at Kobie?

> A few things stand out about this role:
>
> First, the core work matches what I do best. Budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, monthly business reviews—that's my day-to-day. I've been doing this for 4+ years and I'm good at it.
>
> Second, the emphasis on process improvement. I've built a track record of automating finance processes—I reduced reporting time by 80% at my previous role using Excel VBA. The job description mentions driving automation and efficiency, which is exactly where I add value.
>
> Third, the cross-functional nature of the role. Working with Technology, G&A, and Accounting teams is how I prefer to work. Finance shouldn't be siloed—the best insights come from understanding the full business context.
>
> And honestly, the remote-first culture is important to me. I'm based in Seattle and work best with the flexibility that remote work provides.

---

### Why Kobie specifically?

> Kobie has an interesting position in the market—you're a loyalty marketing leader working with major brands, but with a culture that emphasizes people and values. Being named a Top Workplace in the USA and Top Remote Workplace signals that you've figured out how to build a great team environment.
>
> I also like the Finance team's mission as described in the job posting: "stewards of the financial resources of the business" and "reinvesting in human capital." That's a more intentional way of thinking about finance than just reporting numbers.
>
> The values-led culture where "everyone is a leader" resonates with me. In my consulting work, I've had to take ownership of outcomes without formal authority—that's the kind of environment where I thrive.

---

### Walk me through your relevant FP&A experience

> I have about four years of hands-on FP&A experience across consulting and business management.
>
> Currently, I'm an independent consultant doing financial strategy for multiple clients. My work includes budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, and monthly reporting. I prepare executive dashboards, lead re-forecasting cycles, and partner with stakeholders to build driver-based projections. I've also automated reporting workflows—for one client, I set up Salesforce reporting for 2,000+ accounts.
>
> Before consulting, I spent four years as Business Manager for a transportation company. I owned a $500K+ annual budget, did monthly P&L reporting, and partnered with accounting on month-end close. I calculated accruals, tracked expenses against budget, and prepared variance explanations for leadership. I also automated our financial reporting using Excel VBA, which cut manual work by 80%.
>
> The common thread is full-cycle FP&A: budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, close support, and executive reporting—all with a focus on process improvement.

---

### Tell me about your experience with process automation

> This is probably my biggest value-add. I'm not content to just do the work—I want to make the work better.
>
> At Thind Transport, our monthly reporting was entirely manual. I rebuilt the process using Excel VBA: automated data pulls, dynamic dashboards, and one-click report generation. The result was an 80% reduction in reporting time. What used to take days became hours.
>
> In my consulting work, I automated CRM reporting for a client with 2,000+ accounts using Salesforce. The previous process involved manual data exports and spreadsheet manipulation. Now it's a configured workflow that runs automatically.
>
> I also use AI tools (Cursor, ChatGPT) to accelerate analysis and model-building. I'm always looking for ways to eliminate repetitive work so I can focus on the analysis that actually drives decisions.

---

### How do you approach cross-functional collaboration?

> I start by understanding what the other team needs, not just what I need from them.
>
> For example, when working with Accounting on month-end close, I learned their timeline pressures and what data they need from me to do their job efficiently. That led to better handoffs and fewer last-minute scrambles.
>
> With business stakeholders, I translate financial concepts into terms they care about. A department head doesn't need to know the details of my variance analysis methodology—they need to know if they're on track, what's driving the gap, and what to do about it.
>
> The key is recognizing that Finance serves the business, not the other way around. The goal is enabling good decisions, not just producing accurate reports.

---

### Do you have experience with Planful?

> I don't have direct Planful experience, but I've worked with enterprise financial systems like Salesforce and I pick up new software quickly.
>
> My approach when learning a new tool:
> 1. Understand the data model—what's the system actually tracking?
> 2. Learn the core workflows that drive 80% of the value
> 3. Ask questions and find the power users who can accelerate my learning
>
> I taught myself Salesforce automation for a client project in under two weeks. I'd apply the same approach to Planful.
