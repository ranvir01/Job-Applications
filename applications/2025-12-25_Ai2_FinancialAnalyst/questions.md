## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this Financial Analyst role at Ai2?

> A few things drew me to this role.
>
> First, the mission. Ai2 is doing foundational AI research to solve real problems—that's work that matters. I use AI tools every day in my own work, so I understand both the potential and the responsibility that comes with advancing the field. Being part of the finance team that enables that research is meaningful to me.
>
> Second, the role itself. It combines core FP&A work—budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, Board reporting—with grant management. That's a new area for me, but one I want to learn. Tracking restricted vs. unrestricted funds, ensuring compliance, working with funders—it's a different dimension of financial management that I think would make me a more well-rounded analyst.
>
> Third, I'm local to Seattle. I grew up here, went to UW, and I'm excited about the possibility of working at Ai2's waterfront office. No relocation needed—I can start contributing right away.

### Why Ai2 specifically?

> Ai2 has a unique position in the AI landscape. You're a nonprofit research institute focused on open science and AI for good—that's different from the big tech labs that are primarily commercial. The work you've done with OLMo and Semantic Scholar shows a commitment to making AI research accessible.
>
> I also like that Ai2 was founded by Paul Allen with a mission orientation from day one. That culture comes through in the job description—the emphasis on integrity, transparency, and accountability. Those are values I share.
>
> And honestly, the benefits and culture sound great. A learning organization with guest speakers, work-life balance emphasis, kayaks outside the office—it's the kind of environment where I think I'd thrive.

### Walk me through your relevant FP&A experience

> I have about four years of hands-on FP&A experience.
>
> Currently, I'm an independent consultant doing financial strategy for multiple clients. My work includes budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, and financial modeling. I've delivered valuations, built executive dashboards, and prepared Board-level presentations. I also automated reporting systems for a client with 2,000+ accounts.
>
> Before that, I spent four years managing financial operations for a family transportation business. I owned a $500K+ annual budget, did monthly P&L reporting, and worked closely with accounting on month-end close. I tracked expenses across categories to ensure we stayed within budget—similar to monitoring spending against allocations. I also automated our reporting using Excel VBA, which cut manual work by 80%.
>
> What I bring is the full cycle of FP&A work: budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, close support, and executive reporting. The grant management piece is new, but the underlying skills—tracking expenditures, ensuring compliance, reporting to stakeholders—transfer directly.

---

### You don't have grant management experience. How would you get up to speed?

> You're right that I don't have direct nonprofit grant experience, but I have related skills that transfer.
>
> In my current work, I track budgets against projections and explain variances—that's the same discipline needed for grant tracking. I've worked with restricted allocations (specific expense categories that can't be exceeded) and compliance requirements (contracts, vendor terms). The framework of "money in, money out, report accurately, stay compliant" is similar whether it's a grant or a business budget.
>
> To get up to speed quickly, I'd:
> 1. Study Uniform Guidance and nonprofit accounting principles
> 2. Shadow whoever currently handles grant reporting to learn the workflows
> 3. Review past funder reports to understand what's expected
> 4. Ask questions—lots of them
>
> I'm a fast learner, especially with systems and processes. I taught myself Salesforce automation for a client project and used AI tools to accelerate learning. I'd apply the same approach here.

### Tell me about your experience with Board reporting

> At my consulting work, I prepare executive dashboards and Board-ready presentations for clients. The goal is always to synthesize complex financial data into a clear narrative that non-finance stakeholders can understand.
>
> For example, when I delivered a business valuation, I didn't just hand over a spreadsheet. I created a one-page summary with the key findings, a visual showing the valuation range and drivers, and talking points for the client to use with their board. The full model was detailed, but the presentation was accessible.
>
> I think about Board reporting as storytelling with data: What's the headline? What do they need to know? What action should they take? I keep it concise and anticipate questions they might ask.

---

### How do you stay organized when managing multiple workstreams?

> I'm systematic about organization. I use a combination of project tracking tools (Notion), calendar blocking, and regular reviews.
>
> When I was managing three client engagements simultaneously—each with different deliverables and timelines—I maintained a master tracker with every task, deadline, and status. I'd review it daily and adjust priorities as needed. If something was at risk of slipping, I'd flag it early and communicate proactively.
>
> For finance work specifically, I build in buffer time for the unexpected. Month-end close always has surprises, so I plan for that. I also document my processes so I'm not relying on memory—if I'm out, someone else can pick up where I left off.
>
> The key is being proactive, not reactive. I'd rather prevent problems than scramble to fix them.
