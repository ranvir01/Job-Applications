## 📋 Key Application Questions

### 1. Why are you interested in this role?

**Your Answer:**
> I want to be where strategy meets technology at scale. The Microsoft Strategy team has a track record of reshaping the company—from the cloud transformation to now defining the economics of AI. I've spent the last year integrating AI tools into financial strategy work for clients, seeing firsthand how AI changes everything from analysis speed to the types of problems you can solve. Working on AI strategy at Microsoft's level—across Infrastructure, Platform, and Applications—would let me apply my strategic and financial skills to questions that will define the industry for the next decade.

---

### 2. Why Microsoft?

**Your Answer:**
> Three reasons: First, the AI Strategy team sits in the Office of the CEO and works on decisions that actually change the company—like the GitHub and Nuance acquisitions. That's the kind of high-impact work I want to do. Second, Microsoft is uniquely positioned across the entire AI stack—from Azure infrastructure to Copilot applications—so the strategic questions here are more interesting than anywhere else. Third, the team's culture of truth-seeking and questioning the status quo aligns with how I work. I don't just accept assumptions; I dig into the data to find what's actually true.

### 3. Walk me through your resume / Tell me about yourself

**Your Answer:**
> I'm a Finance major from UW Foster with 4+ years of hands-on experience in financial strategy. For the past year, I've run my own consulting practice, delivering valuations, financial models, and strategic recommendations that drove 15-20% returns for clients. One project had me build a $1.45M-$1.75M business valuation from scratch—market analysis, EBITDA multiples, sensitivity testing, executive presentation.

> Before that, I managed financial operations for a family transportation business. I owned a $500K+ budget, automated our entire reporting process with VBA, and grew revenue 33% through data-driven strategic planning.

> What makes me different is that I'm already AI-native. I use tools like Cursor and OpenAI APIs not just for analysis, but to build products—I redesigned a client's website using AI-assisted development. I want to bring that hands-on understanding of AI's potential to Microsoft's strategic work.

---

### 4. What are your greatest strengths?

**Your Answer:**
> 1. **Analytical rigor with speed** – I can build a financial model, stress-test the assumptions, and present insights to executives quickly. My VBA automation cut reporting time by 80% at Thind Transport.

> 2. **Intellectual curiosity** – I don't just use AI tools; I understand how they work. I've built with OpenAI APIs, used Cursor for development, and constantly explore new capabilities. When I encounter something I don't know, I learn it fast.

> 3. **Translating complexity into clarity** – Whether it's a business valuation or a strategic recommendation, I can distill complex analysis into clear insights that drive decisions. I've presented to boards and executives across multiple client engagements.

---

### 5. What is your greatest weakness?

**Your Answer:**
> I sometimes go too deep too fast. When I'm working on a valuation or strategic analysis, I want to understand every assumption and explore every scenario. That's valuable, but I've learned to step back and ask: "What does the decision-maker actually need?" Now I start with the key question and work backward, which keeps me focused on insights that matter versus analysis for its own sake.

## 🎯 Behavioral Questions (STAR Format)

### Tell me about a time you questioned the status quo

**Situation:**
> A client came to me wanting a simple website refresh. Standard SEO optimization project.

**Task:**
> Deliver the website redesign they requested.

**Action:**
> After analyzing their business, I realized their real problem wasn't the website—it was that they had no CRM automation. They were manually tracking 2,000+ client accounts. I pushed back on the original scope and proposed automating their Salesforce workflows first, then redesigning the website with proper analytics integration.

**Result:**
> The CRM automation improved their data accuracy 30% and actually made the SEO work more effective because now they could track lead sources properly. The client got more value than they asked for because I questioned the assumption behind their original request.

---

### Tell me about a time you dove deep into something technical

**Situation:**
> I needed to build a website for a client, but had limited web development experience.

**Task:**
> Deliver a professional website with SEO and analytics—not just a template.

**Action:**
> I used Cursor (AI coding assistant) and Next.js to build the site from scratch. I didn't just prompt my way through—I learned React components, SEO optimization, and analytics integration. Spent nights understanding how the code actually worked so I could customize it properly.

**Result:**
> Built a production-quality site that increased qualified leads 25% through organic search. More importantly, I proved to myself that I can dive deep into unfamiliar technical territory when the problem demands it.

---

### Tell me about a time you delivered strategic recommendations to leadership

**Situation:**
> Tabletop Village LLC was considering a sale and needed to understand their business value.

**Task:**
> Deliver a credible valuation range that could inform their decision-making.

**Action:**
> I built a comprehensive valuation model using EBITDA multiples and comparable company analysis. Gathered market data, stress-tested assumptions through sensitivity analysis, and identified key value drivers. Prepared a Board-level presentation that explained not just the numbers, but what they meant for the client's options.

**Result:**
> Delivered a $1.45M–$1.75M valuation range with clear rationale. The client used this analysis to inform their negotiations. The presentation became a template for how I deliver strategic insights—not just data, but actionable recommendations.

---

### Tell me about a time you collaborated across functions

**Situation:**
> At Thind Transport, I managed financial operations but kept encountering issues caused by disconnects between operations, accounting, and leadership.

**Task:**
> Improve our forecasting accuracy and budget tracking.

**Action:**
> I built an automated dashboard that pulled data from operations (fleet utilization, maintenance schedules), connected it to financial projections, and made it accessible to leadership. Had to work with the operations manager to understand what data mattered, with accounting to ensure accuracy, and with leadership to understand what decisions they needed to make.

**Result:**
> Forecasting became much more accurate because we had real operational data feeding into financial projections. The dashboard became the single source of truth for monthly planning meetings.

## 📝 Role-Specific Questions

### What's your view on AI's impact on the technology industry?

**Your Answer:**
> AI is a platform shift comparable to mobile and cloud. But the economics are different—AI is more compute-intensive, more data-dependent, and changes faster. The companies that will win are those who can stack advantages across all three layers: infrastructure (compute), platform (models and tools), and applications (user value). Microsoft is uniquely positioned because Azure gives you infrastructure, OpenAI partnership gives you platform, and M365/Copilot gives you distribution to billions of users.

> The interesting strategic question is how these layers interact. Does application-layer success drive infrastructure demand, or does infrastructure availability enable new applications? That's the kind of "Economics of AI" question I'd want to explore.

---

### How do you approach a new strategic problem?

**Your Answer:**
> I start by defining the decision we're trying to inform. Then I work backward: What would we need to believe for Option A to be right? What evidence would change our minds? I build a simple model first to understand the key sensitivities, then go deeper on the factors that actually matter.

> For example, on the Tabletop Village valuation, I didn't start with a 50-tab spreadsheet. I started with: "What multiple would a buyer pay, and what drives that multiple?" That focused the analysis on revenue quality, customer concentration, and growth trajectory—the factors that actually determined value.

---

### What experience do you have with M&A analysis?

**Your Answer:**
> I've done two types of M&A work. First, buy-side diligence—when I valued Tabletop Village, I was essentially building what an acquirer would want to see: EBITDA bridge, customer analysis, growth assumptions, risk factors. Second, I've worked with clients considering acquisitions of smaller competitors, helping them think through strategic fit and valuation sanity-checks.

> I don't have investment banking M&A experience, but I understand the strategic questions: Does this acquisition accelerate our strategy? What are we really buying—technology, customers, talent? How do we value synergies versus paying for hope?

## ❓ Questions to Ask Them

*Always have 2-3 questions prepared:*

1. The team wrote the business case for GitHub and Nuance acquisitions. How do you balance exploring new opportunities versus going deep on a smaller number of high-conviction ideas?

2. What does the "Economics of AI" work look like day-to-day? Is it more financial modeling, market analysis, or product-level technical deep dives?

3. How does the strategy team's work translate into actual product decisions? What's the handoff look like between strategy recommendations and product/engineering execution?

4. What's the learning curve like for someone coming from a finance/consulting background versus a product management background?

5. What distinguishes the people who thrive on this team versus those who struggle?
