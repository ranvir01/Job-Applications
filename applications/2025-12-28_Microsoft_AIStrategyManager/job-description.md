## 📝 Job Description

Around 15 years ago, the Microsoft Strategy team made the case for Microsoft's cloud transformation (Economics of the Cloud). This had a profound impact on how we completely rethought our business. Our team engaged deeply in the subsequent years to realize our cloud ambition across every layer of the stack.

As part of the **Office of the CEO**, we are now doing it again with AI, which has emerged as the next big platform shift. In partnership with Microsoft leadership, we are focused on Microsoft's AI strategy across the 3 key layers: **Infrastructure, Platform, Applications/Agents**.

**Work Categories:**
1. **Thought leadership** on the major shifts in the technology industry
2. **Rethink the 'Economics of AI'** across all layers of AI
3. **Translating AI strategy into product reality** across portfolio: Infrastructure, Platform, Applications, Copilots & Agents. This includes both organic product strategy and targeted M&A (the team wrote the business case for the GitHub and Nuance acquisitions)

**Team Culture:** This team has always valued questioning the status quo and truth-seeking. Looking for someone who shares that mindset, is passionate about technology, and brings deep curiosity and high IQ horsepower.

**Ideal Candidates:** Eager to make an impact, from strategy/consulting or product management/product architecture backgrounds.

**Impact:** You will play a key role in the transformation of one of the world's largest software companies and in transforming whole industries as we help customers chart their AI journey. You'll contribute to the team's projects while also being a strategic advisor who looks across Microsoft's product portfolio and influences the direction of current and future products.

**Relocation Required:** This position requires relocation to the Seattle/Redmond area to co-locate with the team 3x/week.
