## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this FP&A Analyst role at Tubi?

> I'm interested for a few reasons.
>
> First, the role itself aligns exactly with what I've been doing—budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, month-end close support. I have four years of this kind of work, and I'm looking for a place where I can go deeper with a larger, more complex organization.
>
> Second, Tubi's position in the streaming market is interesting. You're the leading AVOD platform with over 100 million monthly users, and you're part of Fox Corporation. That means I'd get exposure to both a fast-moving streaming business and the corporate reporting structure of a major media company.
>
> Third, I like that this role works cross-functionally with accounting, operations, and corporate. That's the kind of partnership I've built in my previous work, and it's where I do my best work—not siloed, but connected to the broader business.

---

### Why Tubi specifically?

> Tubi has carved out a unique position in streaming. While everyone else is fighting for subscription revenue, Tubi went all-in on free ad-supported streaming and built a 100 million MAU audience. That's a smart strategic bet on the ad-supported tier that Netflix and others are only now copying.
>
> Being part of Fox Corporation also means there's a sophisticated corporate finance structure backing you up. I'd get to work with Adaptive Planning, Workday, and enterprise-grade reporting—that's experience I want.
>
> And honestly, I like the product. Free streaming with good content is a great value proposition for users. I want to be part of a company where the product makes sense.

### Walk me through your relevant FP&A experience

> I have about four years of hands-on FP&A work across two roles.
>
> Currently, I'm an independent consultant doing financial strategy for multiple clients. My work includes forecasting, variance analysis, and financial modeling. I've delivered valuations up to $1.75M, built executive dashboards, and automated CRM processes for a client with 2,000+ accounts.
>
> Before that, I spent four years managing financial operations for a family transportation business. I owned a $1M+ annual operating budget, did monthly P&L reporting, and worked closely with our accountant on month-end close. I built automated reporting using Excel VBA that cut manual work by 80%. I also prepared variance explanations and financial projections for leadership.
>
> The common thread is taking full ownership of the numbers—budgeting, forecasting, close, variance analysis—and translating them into insights that help people make better decisions.

### Tell me about your experience supporting month-end close

> **Situation:** At Thind Transport, month-end close was a collaborative process between me and our external accountant.
>
> **Task:** My responsibility was to ensure all financial data was accurate, expenses were properly categorized, and any variances from budget were identified and explained.
>
> **Action:** Each month, I'd reconcile our operational data with the accounting records. I'd prepare the P&L summary, flag any unusual expenses, and write up variance explanations for anything that deviated from forecast. If there were intercompany transactions (we had some with related entities), I'd ensure those were documented properly.
>
> **Result:** We consistently closed on time, and the accountant knew they could rely on my data. When we had budget variances—like a spike in maintenance costs one month—I had the analysis ready to explain it. That kind of preparation made the close process smoother for everyone.

### Describe your Excel skills and how you've used them for modeling

> Excel is my primary tool for financial modeling. I'm comfortable with:
>
> - **VBA automation:** I built macros that automated our monthly reporting, cutting manual work by 80%. Data would flow in, get transformed, and produce formatted reports with one click.
>
> - **Complex formulas:** INDEX/MATCH, nested IF statements, array formulas. I've built models that handle large datasets and dynamic scenarios.
>
> - **Model architecture:** I think about how models are structured—inputs separated from calculations, clear documentation, error-checking built in. A model that only I can understand isn't useful.
>
> - **Pivot tables and analysis:** For quick analysis of large datasets, pivot tables are essential. I use them constantly for P&L analysis and expense breakdowns.
>
> I've also started using AI tools to accelerate Excel work. I use ChatGPT and Cursor to help write VBA code or troubleshoot complex formulas. It makes me faster without sacrificing quality.

### How do you approach cross-functional partnerships?

> I start by understanding what the other team needs and what constraints they're working under.
>
> At Thind Transport, I worked closely with our accountant on month-end close. I learned early that if I gave them clean, organized data with clear documentation, they could do their job faster. So I structured my output to make their work easier, not harder.
>
> In my consulting work, I partner with clients across different functions. The key is communication—being clear about what I need from them, being responsive when they need something from me, and keeping everyone aligned on timelines.
>
> For a role like this at Tubi, I'd apply the same approach. If I'm the liaison between FP&A and accounting or tax or treasury, my job is to make those handoffs seamless and ensure data integrity throughout.

### What experience do you have with financial systems like Adaptive Planning or Workday?

> I haven't worked directly with Adaptive Planning or Workday, but I've worked with enterprise systems like Salesforce and built integrations with those.
>
> The pattern is similar across financial systems: you have a chart of accounts or GL structure, you have data flows for forecasts and actuals, and you have reporting outputs. I learn systems quickly by understanding the underlying logic first.
>
> For my CRM automation project, I had to learn Salesforce's data model, understand how records related to each other, and build workflows that maintained data integrity. I'd approach Workday and Adaptive the same way—understand the structure, then execute.
>
> I'm also a fast learner. I use AI tools to accelerate my learning curve on new systems, which helps me get up to speed faster than most.
