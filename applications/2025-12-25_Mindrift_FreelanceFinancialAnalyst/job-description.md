## 📝 Job Description

```
At Mindrift, innovation meets opportunity. We believe in using the power of collective intelligence to ethically shape the future of AI.

What we do:
The Mindrift platform connects specialists with AI projects from major tech innovators. Our mission is to unlock the potential of Generative AI by tapping into real-world expertise from across the globe.

Who we're looking for:
We're looking for curious and intellectually proactive contributors, the kind of person who double-checks assumptions and plays devil's advocate.

Are you comfortable with ambiguity and complexity? Does an async, remote, flexible opportunity sound exciting? Would you like to learn how modern AI systems are tested and evaluated?

This is a flexible, project-based opportunity well-suited for:
- Analysts, researchers, experienced professionals and consultants with strong critical thinking skills.
- People open to a part-time and non-permanent opportunity.

About the project:
You will create complex, realistic tasks that push frontier AI agents to their limits. Think scattered data, conditional procedures, and genuine domain expertise required. You'll build a detailed version with objective scoring, then write an ambiguous version intended to train the agent to succeed with less hand-holding. Real expert complexity only. You're improving the AI tools you'll eventually use yourself.
