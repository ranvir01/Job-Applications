## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this Forward Deployed Accountant role at FloQast?

> This role sits at the intersection of three things I care about: accounting, AI, and customer impact.
>
> First, the AI piece. I use Cursor and ChatGPT every day to build financial models and automate workflows. I've seen firsthand how AI can transform accounting work—reducing hours of manual reconciliation to minutes. Helping accounting teams deploy AI Agents is exactly the kind of work I want to do.
>
> Second, the customer-facing aspect. I've been doing consulting work for the past year, and I love the direct impact—understanding a client's problem, building a solution, training them on it, and seeing the outcome. This role is that, at scale, with a product I believe in.
>
> Third, the domain. I have a finance background with hands-on accounting experience—month-end close, reconciliations, journal entries, variance analysis. I understand the workflows you're automating because I've done them.
>
> Plus, FloQast was built by accountants for accountants. That's compelling.

---

### Walk me through your experience with accounting workflows

> I've worked across core accounting workflows in both consulting and operations roles:
>
> **Month-end close**: At Thind Transport, I partnered with accounting on monthly close—journal entries, accruals, account reconciliations. I ensured expenses were properly categorized and financials tied out.
>
> **Variance analysis**: I performed detailed variance analysis versus budget and prior periods, identifying key drivers and preparing explanations for leadership. This was a monthly discipline. In my consulting work, I did this at scale—analyzing 4 years of P&L data for a business valuation, calculating year-over-year changes in revenue, COGS, and expenses.
>
> **Financial statement analysis**: For Tabletop Village, I reviewed 4 years of P&L and Balance Sheet data, calculated financial ratios (current ratio, debt-to-equity, margins), and compared to industry benchmarks. This gave me deep exposure to how financial statements flow together.
>
> **EBITDA adjustments**: As part of the valuation, I normalized EBITDA by adjusting for below-market owner salary, below-market rent, and employee compensation. This is the same discipline as journal entry adjustments—understanding what belongs in the normalized picture.
>
> **Reconciliations**: Ensuring GL accounts matched supporting documentation, investigating and resolving discrepancies.
>
> **P&L reporting**: Monthly financial reporting, tracking revenue and expenses, preparing management reports. For the valuation, I created a 46-page investor-ready report synthesizing complex financial data.
>
> I understand these workflows from the inside, which is exactly what you need when deploying automation for accounting teams.

### Tell me about your experience with automation

> Automation is where I add the most value. Three examples:

> **Excel VBA automation**: At Thind Transport, monthly financial reporting was entirely manual. I rebuilt the process using Excel VBA—automated data pulls, dynamic dashboards, one-click report generation. The result was an **80% reduction in reporting time**. What took days became hours.

> **Salesforce workflow automation & system transformation**: For AI-Driven Business Growth, I took on a broken Salesforce instance:
> - **Fixed lead-to-opportunity conversion** (rebuilt the entire flow—field mappings, UserID passing, button visibility)
> - **Cleaned 700+ duplicate records** (mass merge without data loss)
> - **Built automated task creation flow** (every new lead → task auto-created with pre-filled context for sales rep)
> - **Created executive dashboards** (CFO got real-time pipeline visibility with color-coded win rates)
> - Result: **95% conversion completion rate**, zero manual task creation, real-time reporting replacing static spreadsheets

> I also use AI tools daily:
> - **Cursor**: My primary environment for building Python financial models with AI assistance
> - **ChatGPT**: Rapid research, debugging, brainstorming automation approaches (used extensively for Salesforce Flow troubleshooting)

> The pattern is the same: understand the manual process, break it into steps, identify what can be automated, build and test, train users, document.

### How do you break down complex accounting processes into automatable steps?

> I follow a structured approach:
>
> 1. **Map the current process**: What are the inputs? What transformations happen? What's the output? Who does what?
>
> 2. **Identify the pain points**: What's manual? What's error-prone? What takes the most time?
>
> 3. **Break into discrete steps**: Each step should have a clear trigger, action, and output. If a step is too complex, decompose further.
>
> 4. **Classify by automation potential**: Some steps are rule-based (high automation potential). Some require judgment (lower potential or need AI).
>
> 5. **Design the automation**: Map each step to the appropriate tool—formula, workflow rule, API call, AI agent.
>
> 6. **Test edge cases**: What happens when data is missing? When there are exceptions?
>
> **Example 1 - P&L Reporting**: I broke the process into: (1) data extraction from source systems, (2) categorization and mapping, (3) variance calculation, (4) exception flagging, (5) report generation. Each step became a module I could automate individually, then chain together.
>
> **Example 2 - Business Valuation**: For the Tabletop Village valuation, I decomposed a complex analysis into structured steps:
> - **Step 1: Financial Statement Analysis** (P&L review, Balance Sheet review, 4 years of data)
> - **Step 2: Financial Ratio Calculation** (liquidity, leverage, profitability ratios)
> - **Step 3: Industry Benchmarking** (compare ratios to industry averages)
> - **Step 4: EBITDA Adjustments** (normalize for owner salary, rent, interest, employee compensation)
> - **Step 5: Multiple Application** (apply industry EBITDA multiples)
> - **Step 6: Valuation Calculation** (range determination based on financial health)
>
> Each step had clear inputs, methodology, and outputs. The result was a $1.45M-$1.75M valuation with supporting analysis. That's the same discipline I'd use when configuring AI Agents—breaking complex accounting workflows into structured, automatable steps.

### How do you approach training and enablement for new users?

> I think about enablement in layers:
>
> **Level 1 – Concept**: Why does this exist? What problem does it solve? This builds buy-in.
>
> **Level 2 – Process**: How does it work? Walk through the workflow step by step.
>
> **Level 3 – Hands-on**: Do it with me. Guided exercises where they actually use the system.
>
> **Level 4 – Independent**: Do it yourself. Office hours for questions.
>
> **Level 5 – Teach others**: The best way to learn is to teach. Identify power users who can help their peers.
>
> At Thind Transport, when I rolled out automated reporting, I documented the process, held training sessions, and was available for questions. The key was making people comfortable—showing them it's not magic, it's just structured steps they can understand.
>
> I also believe in good documentation. If I get hit by a bus, someone should be able to pick up where I left off.

### You don't have a CPA. How do you think about that gap?

> You're right—I don't have a CPA. But here's what I do have:
>
> - **Finance degree with accounting coursework**: Managerial Accounting, Corporate Finance, Financial Modeling from UW Foster
> - **Hands-on experience**: Month-end close, journal entries, reconciliations, variance analysis—I've done the work
> - **Deep financial analysis**: I led a comprehensive business valuation—analyzed 4 years of P&L and Balance Sheet, normalized EBITDA, calculated financial ratios. That required understanding how financial statements tie together.
> - **Understanding of accounting principles**: I know how debits and credits flow, how accruals work, how adjustments impact financial statements
>
> The CPA would formalize what I already understand practically. I'm interested in pursuing it, and this role would accelerate that development.
>
> More importantly, for this role, the value is in the intersection of accounting knowledge and technical implementation. I bring both—I understand the workflows AND I can build automation solutions.

### Tell me about your experience with financial analysis or finance transformation

> My strongest example is the Tabletop Village business valuation I led in 2024.
>
> **The situation**: The owner of a Seattle retail business needed a credible valuation for potential investor discussions. He had years of financial data but no formal analysis.
>
> **What I did**:
> - Analyzed 4 years of P&L and Balance Sheet data (2020-2024)
> - Performed variance analysis on revenue, COGS, and operating expenses (revenue grew from $60K to $1.3M)
> - Calculated 10+ financial ratios and benchmarked against industry averages
> - Normalized EBITDA by adjusting for below-market owner salary, below-market rent, and employee compensation
> - Applied EBITDA multiples (3-5x range based on industry research)
> - Created a 46-page investor-ready report with executive summary, methodology, and appendices
>
> **The result**: Delivered a $1.45M to $1.75M valuation. The owner used it for investor conversations. I explained complex valuation methodology to a non-finance stakeholder—the same skill needed for training accounting teams on FloQast.
>
> This experience gave me deep exposure to financial statement analysis, variance analysis, and the discipline of creating professional deliverables for stakeholders.
