## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this Financial Analyst role at Mindful Support Services?

> A few things drew me to this role:
>
> First, the mission. Mental health access is genuinely important work. Supporting 2,300+ providers who help people get the care they need—that's meaningful. I want my finance work to contribute to something that matters.
>
> Second, the role itself. It covers the full FP&A cycle: budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, close support, and strategic analysis. That's exactly what I've been doing for 4+ years, and I'm good at it. I also noticed the emphasis on process improvement and automation—that's where I add the most value.
>
> Third, location. I'm local to Seattle, so Mountlake Terrace is an easy commute. I'm ready to be on-site and part of the team.

---

### Walk me through your FP&A experience

> I have about four years of hands-on FP&A experience across consulting and business management.
>
> Currently, I'm an independent consultant doing financial strategy for multiple clients. My work includes budgeting, monthly forecasting, variance analysis, and management reporting. I build financial models, prepare executive dashboards, and provide actionable insights to support decision-making.
>
> Before consulting, I spent four years as Business Manager for a transportation company. I owned a $500K+ annual budget, did monthly P&L reporting, and partnered with accounting on month-end close—including journal entries, accruals, and reconciliations. I also performed variance analysis to identify key drivers and trends, and automated our financial reporting using Excel VBA, which cut manual work by 80%.
>
> The common thread is full-cycle FP&A: budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, close support, and delivering insights that support strategic decisions.

### Tell me about your experience with month-end close

> At Thind Transport, I partnered with accounting on monthly close. My responsibilities included:
>
> - **Journal entries**: Recording accruals and adjustments
> - **Account reconciliations**: Ensuring GL accounts tied to supporting documentation
> - **Variance analysis**: Comparing actuals to budget and prior periods, identifying drivers
> - **Management reporting**: Preparing reports for leadership review
>
> The key was timing and accuracy. Close has a rhythm—you need to hit deadlines while ensuring data integrity. I learned to build in reconciliation checkpoints throughout the month so close wasn't a scramble.
>
> In my current consulting work, I continue to support close processes for clients—ensuring revenue is recorded correctly, expenses are accrued, and financials are accurate.

---

### How do you approach variance analysis?

> I follow a structured approach:
>
> 1. **Calculate the variance**: Actual vs. budget, actual vs. prior period, actual vs. forecast
> 2. **Identify the drivers**: Break it down—is it volume, price, timing, one-time items?
> 3. **Quantify the impact**: Not just "revenue was up" but "revenue increased $50K due to X"
> 4. **Tell the story**: What does leadership need to know? What's actionable?
>
> For example, at Thind Transport, I'd analyze monthly P&L variances and present them to leadership. If fuel costs spiked, I'd show how much, why (market prices vs. consumption), and what we could do about it. The goal isn't just explaining the numbers—it's providing insights that drive decisions.

---

### Tell me about a time you improved a financial process

> When I joined Thind Transport, monthly financial reporting was entirely manual. Pulling data, building reports, formatting for leadership—it took days each month.
>
> I rebuilt the process using Excel VBA:
> - Created automated data pulls from our source systems
> - Built dynamic dashboards that updated automatically
> - Standardized report formats so they were consistent month to month
>
> The result was an **80% reduction in reporting time**. What used to take days became hours. More importantly, it improved accuracy—fewer manual steps meant fewer errors.
>
> I also documented the process so it wasn't dependent on me. Anyone could run the reports if needed.

### You don't have healthcare experience. How would you get up to speed?

> You're right—I don't have direct healthcare or mental health industry experience. But I have transferable skills:
>
> - **Service-based business**: I've managed finances for a service business with complex billing, multiple revenue streams, and vendor relationships
> - **Multi-stakeholder environment**: Mental health billing involves patients, insurers, and providers—similar to managing client contracts, vendors, and internal teams
> - **Fast learner**: I taught myself Salesforce automation for a client project. I'd apply the same intensity to learning healthcare finance
>
> My approach to getting up to speed:
> 1. Study the billing and payments workflows—how revenue flows from patients/insurers to providers
> 2. Learn the key metrics and KPIs specific to mental health services
> 3. Shadow the team to understand current processes before trying to improve them
> 4. Ask questions—lots of them
>
> The core FP&A skills transfer directly. The industry context, I'll learn quickly.
