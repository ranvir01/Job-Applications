## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this FP&A Analyst role at Spotify?

> Three things drew me to this role.
>
> First, the job description explicitly asks for experience with AI tools—ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude. That's rare. Most finance roles are still catching up to what's possible with AI, but Spotify clearly gets it. I use these tools every day in my work. Cursor is my primary development environment, and I use ChatGPT and Claude constantly for analysis, modeling, and automating workflows. This isn't a skill I'd need to learn—it's how I already work.
>
> Second, the scope of the role is compelling. You're not just asking for someone to run reports. Legal entity forecasting across 30+ entities, long-range planning, capital allocation—this is complex, strategic work. I want to be in an environment where the problems are hard enough to be interesting.
>
> Third, it's Spotify. I've been a user for years, and I find the business model genuinely interesting. The interplay between subscriptions, ad-supported tiers, and creator payouts creates a complex financial picture. I want to understand how that works from the inside.

### How do you use AI tools in your financial work?

> AI is integrated into basically everything I do now. Let me give you specific examples.
>
> **Cursor:** I use Cursor as my primary development environment. When I'm building financial models or automating processes, I work with Claude inside Cursor to write VBA, Python, or SQL code. What used to take hours—like building a complex data transformation or debugging a formula—now takes minutes. I recently used it to automate Salesforce workflows for a client with 2,000+ accounts.
>
> **ChatGPT/Claude:** I use these for rapid analysis and research. When I'm working on a valuation or need to understand an industry, I'll use AI to quickly synthesize information, stress-test my assumptions, or draft narrative sections of presentations. It's not about replacing my thinking—it's about accelerating it.
>
> **Practical example:** For a recent client valuation, I used Claude to help me build sensitivity tables and scenario analyses faster than I could manually. I still made all the judgment calls on assumptions, but the AI helped me iterate through scenarios in a fraction of the time.
>
> The key is knowing what AI is good at (speed, pattern recognition, code generation) and what still requires human judgment (assumptions, context, stakeholder communication).

### Tell me about your experience with financial modeling

> I've been building financial models for about four years, across different contexts.
>
> **Valuation models:** I delivered a business valuation for a client using EBITDA multiples and sensitivity analysis. The output was a $1.45M-$1.75M range that helped them understand their exit options.
>
> **Forecasting models:** At Thind Transport, I built and maintained our budget and forecast models. These tracked revenue, costs, and cash flow monthly. I'd update projections quarterly and prepare variance explanations for leadership.
>
> **Automation:** I've automated a lot of repetitive modeling work using VBA and now AI tools. My focus is always on making models scalable and maintainable—not just getting to an answer once, but building something that can be updated easily.
>
> What I bring is the combination of modeling skills and technical ability. I can build the model AND automate the process around it.

### Describe your SQL experience

> I use SQL regularly for querying and analyzing data. At my consulting work, I've used it to pull data from Salesforce and other databases for analysis.
>
> A specific example: I analyzed customer behavior data from 200+ survey responses using SQL queries to segment users and identify trends. I then brought the results into Excel for visualization and presentation.
>
> I'm comfortable with JOINs, aggregations, CTEs, and filtering large datasets. I wouldn't call myself a data engineer, but I can navigate a database, write efficient queries, and pull the data I need for analysis.
>
> I've also used SQL in combination with AI tools—describing what I need in natural language and using Claude to help write or debug queries. That workflow makes me faster and more effective.

### How do you approach distilling complexity for non-technical audiences?

> I follow a simple framework: start with the "so what," use visuals, and anticipate questions.
>
> When I'm presenting to executives or non-financial stakeholders, I lead with the conclusion. What does this mean for the business? What decision should we make? I don't walk them through every calculation—I show them the output and the key drivers.
>
> Visuals matter. A well-designed chart communicates faster than a table of numbers. I spend time thinking about what the audience actually needs to see, not just what I calculated.
>
> Finally, I try to anticipate the questions they'll ask and have the detail ready. If they want to dig into the assumptions, I can show them. But I don't force that level of detail on everyone.
>
> A specific example: When presenting a client valuation, I created a one-page summary with the valuation range and three key drivers. The full model was 15 tabs, but the executive summary fit on one slide.

### Tell me about a time you automated or improved a process

> **Situation:** At Thind Transport, our financial reporting was entirely manual. Every month, I'd spend hours pulling data from different sources, copying it into spreadsheets, and formatting reports.
>
> **Task:** I wanted to reduce this manual work so I could focus on analysis instead of data entry.
>
> **Action:** I rebuilt our reporting process in Excel with VBA automation. I created macros that pulled data, formatted it consistently, and generated the reports with a single click. I also built in validation checks to catch errors automatically.
>
> **Result:** Reporting time dropped by 80%. What used to take hours took minutes. More importantly, the accuracy improved because I wasn't manually copying data. That freed me up to actually analyze the numbers instead of just compiling them.
>
> Now I take automation further using AI tools like Cursor. When I see a repetitive task, my instinct is to automate it.

### Why should we hire you over other candidates?

> I think my differentiator is the combination of solid FP&A fundamentals AND genuine fluency with AI tools.
>
> Lots of candidates have financial modeling experience. Some candidates have heard of ChatGPT. But how many are using Cursor daily to write code, using Claude to accelerate analysis, and thinking about how to integrate AI into every part of their workflow?
>
> Your job description explicitly asks for AI tool experience. That's not an afterthought for me—it's how I work. I can hit the ground running on the automation and efficiency improvements you're looking for, while also delivering on the core FP&A work.
>
> I'm also someone who enjoys complexity. Legal entity forecasting across 30+ entities sounds like exactly the kind of problem I want to solve. Detail and granularity don't scare me—they motivate me.
