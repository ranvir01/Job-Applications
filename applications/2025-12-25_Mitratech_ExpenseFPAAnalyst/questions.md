## 💬 If They Ask Follow-Up Questions

### Walk me through a variance analysis you've done

> At MyConsulting, I compare actuals against forecasts monthly for our clients. For TTV LLC, I noticed their OPEX was running 12% above forecast. I dug into the data, found the variance was driven by contractor costs that weren't in the original budget. I presented this to the client with a revised forecast and recommendations to either reduce contractor spend or adjust the annual budget. They went with a hybrid approach and we got back on track within two months.

### How do you approach building a forecast model?

> I start with historical data—usually 12-24 months of actuals—to understand trends and seasonality. Then I meet with department leaders to understand what's changing going forward. I build the model in Excel with clear assumptions documented so anyone can follow the logic. I also include sensitivity scenarios so leadership can see best/worst case outcomes. The key is keeping it flexible enough to update weekly without breaking.

### Tell me about your experience with Board-level reporting

> At MyConsulting, I helped prepare executive dashboards for a $1.45M-$1.75M business valuation. These went to company leadership and investors. I focused on making complex financial data clear—key metrics up front, trends visualized, and a narrative that explained what the numbers meant. I've learned that executives want the "so what" not just the data dump.

---

### How do you handle tight deadlines?

> I prioritize ruthlessly. When I was managing financial operations at Thind Transport, month-end close was always tight. I built VBA-automated dashboards specifically to cut the crunch—reduced reporting time by 80%. Now when deadlines hit, I focus on what actually matters for the decision at hand, get that done first, and flag anything that needs more time early rather than last minute.

### Why Mitratech?

> Three things stand out to me. First, the role is exactly what I want to grow into—owning forecasting processes and building Board-ready reporting. Second, you're a tech company, and I've worked with Salesforce, Next.js, and SaaS-adjacent clients, so I understand that environment. Third, I like that you're 35 years in but still moving fast—that's the kind of place where I do my best work.

---

### Why are you interested in this role?

> I've spent the last four years doing FP&A work—financial modeling, variance analysis, forecasting—and I want to keep developing in that direction. This role lets me own a forecasting process end-to-end, work cross-functionally with department leaders, and contribute to Board-level decisions. That's exactly where I want to be.

## 📎 Notes

- **Salary negotiation**: If they offer $68K, counter with $72K citing 4+ years experience vs. their 3+ requirement
- **Remote work**: This is 100% remote, which is great for flexibility
- **Growth angle**: They mention "looking for opportunities to learn and grow"—emphasize your growth mindset
