> "To prepare for this Treasury role, I researched what Treasury analysts actually do and built a practice workbook simulating aircraft financing workflows. I created amortization schedules using PMT functions, payment reconciliations with VLOOKUP, and cash flow forecasts. It gave me hands-on practice and helped me understand why certain controls matter..."

**Story 2: Technical Skills**
> "I'm advanced in Excel. To prepare for Treasury work specifically, I practiced building debt amortization schedules calculating principal and interest splits using PMT, IPMT, and PPMT functions. I also built reconciliation worksheets using INDEX/MATCH to validate payments against schedules, which taught me how Treasury catches variances before they compound..."

**Story 3: Transferable Experience**
> "At Thind Transport, I managed payment processing and reconciliation for a $1M+ budget - similar to Treasury's portfolio management. I built automated controls to flag variances before month-end close and partnered with accounting on journal entries. While it wasn't aircraft debt, the core functions - forecasting cash obligations, processing payments, reconciling to bank statements, supporting close - directly translate to Treasury work..."

## Your Updated Application Answers

### Excel Skills (USE THIS ONE):

"Advanced. I use Excel daily for financial modeling, forecasting, and reconciliation work that directly translates to Treasury operations. 

I regularly build cash flow forecast models to track payment obligations over rolling 12-month periods, payment schedules with principal and interest calculations, and reconciliation tools to validate actual payments against forecasts. I'm proficient with financial functions like PMT, IPMT, and PPMT for debt analysis, along with advanced formulas like INDEX/MATCH and VLOOKUP for payment tracking.

I've also built VBA automation that reduced reporting time by 80% at my previous role - specifically automating monthly financial reports and reconciliations to improve accuracy and internal controls. I created variance analysis worksheets that automatically flag discrepancies greater than set thresholds, which is critical for month-end close and audit documentation.

At Thind Transport, I managed payment processing and budget tracking for a $1M+ portfolio, maintaining accurate records of financial obligations and partnering with accounting on month-end close. I built automated reconciliation controls and maintained documentation for compliance - similar to the SOX requirements mentioned in the Treasury role.

I'm comfortable building complex financial models from scratch, troubleshooting existing spreadsheets, and working with large datasets to ensure accuracy."

### Compensation (USE THIS ONE):

"I have 4+ years of finance experience with strong Excel and financial modeling skills, but I recognize this would be my first Treasury-focused role. Given that, I'm flexible and open to compensation in the $72,000 to $85,000 range depending on whether the team views my background as better aligned with FA I or FA II. I'm more focused on joining a strong team where I can learn Treasury operations and contribute my analytical skills."
