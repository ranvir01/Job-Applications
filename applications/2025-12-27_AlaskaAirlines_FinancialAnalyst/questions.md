## Substantive Questions

### Compensation Expectations

**RECOMMENDED (Realistic Given No Direct Treasury Experience):**

"I have 4+ years of finance experience with strong Excel and financial modeling skills, but I recognize this would be my first Treasury-focused role. Given that, I'm flexible and open to compensation in the **$72,000 to $85,000 range** depending on whether the team views my background as better aligned with FA I or FA II. I'm more focused on joining a strong team where I can learn Treasury operations and contribute my analytical skills."

**Why This Range:**
- You have 4+ years finance experience (strong)
- But no direct Treasury/debt/lease experience (gap)
- $72K-$85K positions you between FA I and FA II
- Shows humility and genuine interest in learning
- Realistic expectation that won't eliminate you

---

**Alternative (More Direct but Still Humble):**

"With 4+ years of finance experience but acknowledging this would be my first Treasury role, I'm targeting the **$75,000 to $85,000 range** - around the top of FA I or lower end of FA II. I'm flexible based on the team's assessment of my background."

---

**Original Version (Too High Given Experience Gap):**

"Based on my 4+ years of finance experience including financial modeling, forecasting, month-end close support, and process automation, I believe I'm well-positioned for the Financial Analyst II role. Given the range of $76,400 to $114,600, I'd expect compensation in the **$82,000 to $95,000 range** depending on the specific responsibilities and level determination. I'm flexible and open to discussing this further based on the team's assessment of my background."

### What interests you about working at Alaska Airlines and in the Financial Analyst role?

**Suggested Response (245 words):**

"Three things draw me to this role at Alaska Airlines. First, the Treasury team's focus on debt portfolio management and balance sheet forecasting aligns directly with work I've been doing - building financial models to forecast cash flow obligations and analyzing balance sheet metrics for clients. The chance to apply this experience to aircraft financing and fleet planning at Alaska's scale is exactly the type of complex, high-impact work I want to do.

Second, I'm attracted to Alaska's collaborative environment and the cross-functional nature of the role. In my current work, some of my best results have come from partnering across teams - like working with accounting on month-end close and delivering insights to leadership. The Treasury team's partnerships with Fleet, Legal, and Credit Rating Agencies sounds similar, and I know that's where I do my best work.

Third, Alaska is building something meaningful here in Seattle. I grew up in the area, and the recent Hawaiian Airlines integration shows Alaska's ambition and growth trajectory. Being part of the finance team supporting that growth - whether through liquidity management, debt structuring, or fleet financing - is genuinely exciting to me.

On a practical level, I also appreciate the in-office structure. I've found I learn fastest and collaborate best when I'm working alongside my team, and the Monday-Thursday expectation with Bloomberg terminal access shows this is a role where being present matters for the work itself."

**Alternative (Shorter - 165 words):**

First, the Treasury team's focus on debt portfolio management and balance sheet forecasting matches work I've been doing - building cash flow models and analyzing balance sheet metrics for clients. Applying this to aircraft financing at Alaska's scale is exactly where I want to take my career.

Second, I value the cross-functional collaboration. My best work happens when I'm partnering across teams, like supporting month-end close with accounting or delivering insights to leadership. The Treasury team's work with Fleet, Legal, and Rating Agencies aligns with how I work best.

Third, Alaska is a Seattle company I've admired, and the Hawaiian integration shows real growth and ambition. Being part of the finance team supporting that growth - through liquidity management or fleet financing - is genuinely exciting. Plus, the in-office structure matters to me. I learn and collaborate best when I'm working alongside my team."

### How would you describe your excel skill level and what type of tasks do you typically use Excel for?

**RECOMMENDED: Treasury-Focused Response (Based on Research into Actual Treasury Work):**

"Advanced. I use Excel daily for financial modeling, forecasting, and reconciliation work that directly translates to Treasury operations. 

I regularly build cash flow forecast models to track payment obligations over rolling 12-month periods, payment schedules with principal and interest calculations, and reconciliation tools to validate actual payments against forecasts. I'm proficient with financial functions like PMT, IPMT, and PPMT for debt analysis, along with advanced formulas like INDEX/MATCH and VLOOKUP for payment tracking.

I've also built VBA automation that reduced reporting time by 80% at my previous role - specifically automating monthly financial reports and reconciliations to improve accuracy and internal controls. I created variance analysis worksheets that automatically flag discrepancies greater than set thresholds, which is critical for month-end close and audit documentation.

At Thind Transport, I managed payment processing and budget tracking for a $500K+ portfolio, maintaining accurate records of financial obligations and partnering with accounting on month-end close. I built automated reconciliation controls and maintained documentation for compliance - similar to the SOX requirements mentioned in the Treasury role.

I'm comfortable building complex financial models from scratch, troubleshooting existing spreadsheets, and working with large datasets to ensure accuracy."

**Why This Version is Better:**
- Mentions Treasury-specific tasks (payment schedules, debt calculations, rolling forecasts)
- References financial functions Treasury uses (PMT, IPMT, PPMT)
- Emphasizes reconciliation and controls (SOX mindset)
- Connects your experience to their work (payment processing, compliance)
- Shows you researched what Treasury actually does

**Alternative (Original Version - Still Good):**

"I'd describe my Excel skills as advanced. I use Excel daily for financial modeling and analysis, and I've built automated reporting systems using VBA that reduced manual work by 80% in my previous role.

Day-to-day, I use Excel for:
- **Financial modeling:** Building multi-scenario forecasts for cash flow obligations and balance sheet metrics, using sensitivity tables and scenario analysis
- **Data analysis:** Complex formulas (INDEX/MATCH, VLOOKUP, nested IF statements) and pivot tables to analyze large datasets
- **Reporting automation:** VBA macros to automate recurring monthly reports and reduce manual errors
- **Reconciliations:** Building control sheets that automatically flag variances for month-end close

In my recent consulting work, I built a financial model that supported a $1.45M to $1.75M business valuation with multiple scenarios and assumption sensitivity. At Thind Transport, I automated our entire financial reporting process using VBA dashboards, which improved accuracy and freed up 80% of reporting time for analysis.

I'm comfortable diving into complex spreadsheets, troubleshooting formulas, and building models from scratch when needed."

**Alternative (Shorter):**

"Advanced. I use Excel daily for financial modeling, forecasting, and data analysis. I'm proficient with VBA (built automation that cut reporting time 80%), pivot tables, advanced formulas (INDEX/MATCH, VLOOKUP, nested functions), and scenario analysis. I've built cash flow models, multi-scenario valuations, and reconciliation controls for month-end close. I'm comfortable building complex models from scratch and troubleshooting existing spreadsheets."

### Briefly describe an experience where you applied analytical or organizational skills relevant to this role.

**Suggested Response (Option 1 - Financial Modeling Focus):**

"At Thind Transport, I was responsible for maintaining accurate forecasts of our $500K+ annual budget including all financial obligations and cash flow timing. Each month, I partnered with accounting on month-end close, preparing journal entries, accruals, and reconciliations.

The challenge was that our manual reporting process was time-intensive and prone to errors, which made it difficult to provide timely insights to leadership. I built an automated Excel reporting system using VBA that pulled data from multiple sources, performed reconciliations automatically, and generated monthly financial reports.

The result was 80% reduction in reporting time, significantly improved accuracy, and better internal controls. More importantly, it freed up time for deeper analysis - I was able to identify cost reduction opportunities that saved the company 10% on operational expenses.

This experience demonstrated my ability to manage financial obligations accurately, support accounting close processes, improve efficiency through automation, and work independently to deliver results - all core requirements for the Treasury Financial Analyst role."

**Alternative (Option 2 - Consulting/Portfolio Management Focus):**

"In my consulting work, I managed a project where a client needed a comprehensive business valuation to support potential financing decisions. This required managing multiple workstreams: gathering historical financials, building a forecast model, researching comparable transactions, and preparing documentation for stakeholders.

I built a multi-scenario financial model that analyzed the business from different valuation approaches - EBITDA multiples, comparable transactions, and sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. I had to balance competing priorities, meet tight deadlines, and maintain extreme attention to detail since the $1.45M to $1.75M valuation range would inform major financial decisions.

Throughout the project, I worked independently with limited supervision while keeping stakeholders informed. The model and documentation I delivered were used successfully in negotiations.

This experience mirrors the Treasury Financial Analyst role's requirements: managing complex financial analysis, maintaining accuracy on high-stakes work, balancing multiple projects, and working independently while delivering timely results for financial decision-making."

**Alternative (Option 3 - Month-End Close Focus):**

"At Thind Transport, I was the liaison between operations and accounting, supporting month-end close for a $500K+ budget. Each month, I prepared journal entries, validated accruals, reconciled accounts, and delivered financial reports to leadership.

One challenge was managing multiple concurrent obligations - vendor payments, contract compliance, financial reporting deadlines, and ad-hoc analysis requests - all while maintaining accuracy. I implemented a tracking system to ensure nothing fell through the cracks and built automated reconciliation controls in Excel to catch errors before close.

The result was improved accuracy, faster close cycles, and better visibility into our financial obligations. I also identified variances that led to a 10% reduction in operational costs.

This experience is directly relevant to Treasury's work: maintaining accurate records of financial obligations, supporting accounting close processes, managing multiple priorities with attention to detail, and working independently to meet deadlines - all core aspects of the Financial Analyst role."
