## Substantive Questions

### Compensation Expectations

"I have 4+ years of finance experience with strong Excel and financial modeling skills, but I recognize this would be my first Treasury-focused role. Given that, I'm flexible and open to compensation in the **$72,000 to $85,000 range** depending on whether the team views my background as better aligned with FA I or FA II. I'm more focused on joining a strong team where I can learn Treasury operations and contribute my analytical skills."

### What interests you about working at Alaska Airlines and in the Financial Analyst role?

"Three things draw me to this role at Alaska Airlines. First, the Treasury team's focus on debt portfolio management and balance sheet forecasting aligns directly with work I've been doing - building financial models to forecast cash flow obligations and analyzing balance sheet metrics for clients. The chance to apply this experience to aircraft financing and fleet planning at Alaska's scale is exactly the type of complex, high-impact work I want to do.

Second, I'm attracted to Alaska's collaborative environment and the cross-functional nature of the role. In my current work, some of my best results have come from partnering across teams - like working with accounting on month-end close and delivering insights to leadership. The Treasury team's partnerships with Fleet, Legal, and Credit Rating Agencies sounds similar, and I know that's where I do my best work.

Third, Alaska is building something meaningful here in Seattle. I grew up in the area, and the recent Hawaiian Airlines integration shows Alaska's ambition and growth trajectory. Being part of the finance team supporting that growth - whether through liquidity management, debt structuring, or fleet financing - is genuinely exciting to me.

On a practical level, I also appreciate the in-office structure. I've found I learn fastest and collaborate best when I'm working alongside my team, and the Monday-Thursday expectation with Bloomberg terminal access shows this is a role where being present matters for the work itself."

### How would you describe your excel skill level and what type of tasks do you typically use Excel for?

"Advanced. I use Excel daily for financial modeling, forecasting, and reconciliation work that directly translates to Treasury operations.

I regularly build cash flow forecast models to track payment obligations over rolling 12-month periods, payment schedules with principal and interest calculations, and reconciliation tools to validate actual payments against forecasts. I'm proficient with financial functions like PMT, IPMT, and PPMT for debt analysis, along with advanced formulas like INDEX/MATCH and VLOOKUP for payment tracking.

I've also built VBA automation that reduced reporting time by 80% at my previous role - specifically automating monthly financial reports and reconciliations to improve accuracy and internal controls. I created variance analysis worksheets that automatically flag discrepancies greater than set thresholds, which is critical for month-end close and audit documentation.

At Thind Transport, I managed payment processing and budget tracking for a $500K+ portfolio, maintaining accurate records of financial obligations and partnering with accounting on month-end close. I built automated reconciliation controls and maintained documentation for compliance - similar to the SOX requirements mentioned in the Treasury role.

I'm comfortable building complex financial models from scratch, troubleshooting existing spreadsheets, and working with large datasets to ensure accuracy."

### Briefly describe an experience where you applied analytical or organizational skills relevant to this role.

"At Thind Transport, I was responsible for maintaining accurate forecasts of our $500K+ annual budget including all financial obligations and cash flow timing. Each month, I partnered with accounting on month-end close, preparing journal entries, accruals, and reconciliations.

The challenge was that our manual reporting process was time-intensive and prone to errors, which made it difficult to provide timely insights to leadership. I built an automated Excel reporting system using VBA that pulled data from multiple sources, performed reconciliations automatically, and generated monthly financial reports.

The result was 80% reduction in reporting time, significantly improved accuracy, and better internal controls. More importantly, it freed up time for deeper analysis - I was able to identify cost reduction opportunities that saved the company 10% on operational expenses.

This experience demonstrated my ability to manage financial obligations accurately, support accounting close processes, improve efficiency through automation, and work independently to deliver results - all core requirements for the Treasury Financial Analyst role."
