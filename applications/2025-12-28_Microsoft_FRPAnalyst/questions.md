# ❓ Application Questions: Microsoft Finance Rotation Program (FRP)

---

## 📋 Application Form Questions

### Why Microsoft?

Microsoft's mission to empower everyone aligns with how I approach finance—using data and analysis to help people make better decisions. The FRP specifically caught my attention because it combines structured learning across different finance functions with exposure to cutting-edge AI tools. As someone who's already integrating AI into financial analysis (I use OpenAI and Cursor to accelerate modeling and reporting), I'm drawn to a company that's leading that transformation. Plus, growing up in Seattle, Microsoft has always been part of the tech landscape I wanted to join.

### Why the Finance Rotation Program?

I want to build a broad foundation in finance before specializing. At MyConsulting Network, I've worked on valuation, FP&A, and operational finance—and I've realized that seeing how these pieces connect makes you a better analyst. FRP's structure of rotating through corporate finance, sales finance, and product groups like Azure or Gaming is exactly the exposure I'm looking for. I'm ready to learn from senior leaders and contribute real work, not just observe.

### Tell me about yourself (2-minute version)

I graduated from UW Foster in Spring 2024 with a Finance degree and 3+ years of hands-on FP&A experience. At MyConsulting Network, I drive 15-20% client returns through financial modeling and valuation work—I recently led a business valuation using EBITDA multiples that projected a $1.45M-$1.75M range. Before that, I managed financial operations for a transportation company where I built VBA dashboards that cut our reporting time by 80% and negotiated contracts that reduced costs 10%.

What makes me different is that I'm already blending traditional finance with AI tools. I use ChatGPT and Cursor to accelerate analysis and prototype models faster. Microsoft's FRP appeals to me because it's built for people with a growth mindset who want to learn across different finance functions while using best-in-class tools.

## 🎯 Behavioral Questions (STAR Format)

### Growth Mindset: Tell me about a time you had to learn something new quickly

**Situation:** When I joined MyConsulting as a Financial Strategist, my first client needed a business valuation—but I'd never done one outside of academic coursework.

**Task:** Deliver a defensible valuation for Tabletop Village LLC within two weeks, working with limited financial data and no established process.

**Action:** I researched comparable company transactions, studied EBITDA multiple methodologies for similar businesses, and built a valuation model from scratch. I validated my assumptions with industry benchmarks and created sensitivity analysis to show the range of outcomes. I also collaborated with a partner who handled the qualitative narrative while I owned the numbers.

**Result:** Delivered a $1.45M-$1.75M valuation range that the client used for strategic planning. The process taught me how to learn under pressure and validate my work without hand-holding—exactly the mindset Microsoft emphasizes.

### Problem-Solving with Data: Describe a time you used data to influence a decision

**Situation:** At Thind Transport, monthly P&L reporting was taking 8+ hours because everything was done manually in disconnected spreadsheets.

**Task:** Find a way to reduce reporting time while maintaining accuracy for executive review.

**Action:** I rebuilt our reporting process using Excel with VBA automation. Created dynamic dashboards that pulled from centralized data, automated variance calculations, and built conditional formatting to flag issues. Trained the team on how to use the new system.

**Result:** Cut monthly reporting time from 8+ hours to under 2 hours (80% reduction). The dashboards enabled real-time variance analysis, which led to faster decision-making. We identified a fuel cost overrun early enough to renegotiate a vendor contract, saving 10% on operational costs.

### Collaboration: Tell me about a time you worked cross-functionally

**Situation:** At MyConsulting, I was automating Salesforce CRM workflows for Goldstein & Company, a firm managing 2,000+ clients. The project required coordination between their operations team, IT, and finance.

**Task:** Deliver an automated reporting system that satisfied different stakeholder requirements—operations wanted simplicity, finance wanted accuracy, IT wanted maintainability.

**Action:** I held discovery sessions with each group to understand their needs. Built the automation in phases, getting feedback after each iteration. Documented everything clearly so IT could maintain it. Created training materials for operations.

**Result:** Successfully automated their client reporting, improving OPEX forecasting accuracy. The phased approach meant stakeholders stayed aligned throughout. The finance team now has real-time visibility into client metrics they previously compiled manually.

### Challenge: Tell me about a time you faced a setback

**Situation:** During my options strategy analysis project at UW (FIN 466), my initial regression model for Masimo stock wasn't producing statistically significant results.

**Task:** I needed to develop a valid collar option strategy with defensible analysis for the final presentation.

**Action:** Instead of forcing the data to fit my hypothesis, I went back to fundamentals. Adjusted my time period, tested different variables, and consulted with my professor on methodology. Rebuilt the model with a cleaner dataset and more rigorous assumptions.

**Result:** The revised analysis produced significant results that supported a specific collar strategy. I learned that being wrong early is fine—what matters is having the intellectual honesty to start over and get it right.

### AI and Innovation: How have you used AI tools in your work?

**Situation:** At MyConsulting, I needed to accelerate the speed of financial analysis while maintaining quality.

**Task:** Find ways to integrate AI tools into my workflow without compromising accuracy.

**Action:** I started using ChatGPT to draft initial analysis frameworks, brainstorm assumptions, and prototype Excel formulas before building them. I use Cursor for coding tasks like VBA scripts or Python data manipulation. Importantly, I always validate AI outputs—I treat them as first drafts, not final answers.

**Result:** Reduced time spent on initial analysis setup by roughly 40%. I can now explore more scenarios and iterate faster. This aligns with Microsoft's emphasis on AI-first thinking—using tools to enhance human judgment, not replace it.
