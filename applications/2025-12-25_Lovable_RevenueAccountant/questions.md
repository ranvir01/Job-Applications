## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this role at Lovable?

> Three things stand out:
>
> First, the company mission. Lovable is democratizing software development—letting anyone build software, regardless of technical background. I use AI tools in my own work, so I understand the potential. Being part of the finance team that enables that growth is exciting.
>
> Second, the role itself. This isn't just "run the existing process"—it's building scalable revenue and billing infrastructure as the company expands into enterprise. I've built financial processes from scratch in my consulting work, and I thrive in build-phase environments where I can shape how things work.
>
> Third, the culture. "Extreme ownership, high velocity, low-ego collaboration" describes how I work best. I take full ownership of outcomes, move fast, and care more about getting it right than being right.

---

### Tell me about your experience with billing and revenue operations

> In my current consulting work, I manage end-to-end financial operations for multiple clients. That includes:
>
> - **Invoicing**: Creating accurate invoices, tracking payment status, following up on collections
> - **Revenue tracking**: Ensuring revenue is recognized in the correct periods, reconciling across months
> - **System configuration**: Automating reporting workflows in Salesforce for a client with 2,000+ accounts
>
> At Thind Transport, I owned invoicing and billing for B2B client contracts—ensuring accuracy, managing collections timing, and reconciling against our P&L. I also partnered with accounting on month-end close, calculating accruals and ensuring financials were accurate.
>
> While I don't have direct Stripe experience, I've worked with enterprise financial systems and I'm technically confident. I partnered with technical teams on Salesforce automation and I'm comfortable learning new billing platforms quickly.

---

### How do you approach working with engineering teams?

> I start by understanding their language and constraints. Engineers think in systems, logic, and edge cases—which actually aligns well with how I approach financial analysis.
>
> When I automated Salesforce reporting for a client, I worked closely with their technical team to understand the data model, identify edge cases in billing scenarios, and configure workflows that handled exceptions properly. I wasn't just handing over requirements—I was collaborating on the solution.
>
> My approach:
> 1. **Understand the system**: What data exists, how it flows, what the constraints are
> 2. **Speak their language**: Frame requirements in terms of logic and data, not just business outcomes
> 3. **Be specific**: Vague requirements create bad implementations; I document expected behavior precisely
> 4. **Test together**: Review edge cases before going live
>
> I'm comfortable in technical environments. I use SQL, Python, and have built automated systems with Excel VBA. I don't need to be walked through how systems work.

### Do you have experience with revenue recognition (ASC 606)?

> I don't have formal ASC 606 experience, but I have the foundation to learn it quickly:
>
> - **Revenue tracking**: In my consulting work, I track revenue recognition timing, ensuring revenue is recorded when earned
> - **Contract-based thinking**: I've worked with B2B contracts where revenue aligns to delivery milestones
> - **Financial reporting**: I prepare P&L reports, calculate accruals, and ensure financial statements are accurate
> - **Reconciliation**: I'm detail-oriented about making sure numbers tie out across periods
>
> I understand the principle: recognize revenue when you've fulfilled the performance obligation, not necessarily when cash comes in. The specific ASC 606 rules around transaction price allocation, variable consideration, etc.—I'd study and apply quickly.
>
> I'm also committed to developing this expertise formally. If this role requires it, I'd pursue relevant certifications or training.

---

### Tell me about a time you built a process from scratch

> At Thind Transport, our financial reporting was entirely manual when I started. There was no systematic way to track P&L, monitor variances, or prepare leadership reports.
>
> I built the process from scratch:
> 1. **Designed the data model**: What metrics to track, where data would come from, how it would flow
> 2. **Built the automation**: Created Excel VBA dashboards that pulled data automatically and generated reports
> 3. **Documented the process**: So it wasn't dependent on me being there
> 4. **Iterated based on feedback**: Adjusted reports based on what leadership actually needed
>
> The result was an 80% reduction in reporting time and reliable, consistent financial visibility that didn't exist before.
>
> That experience—building something where nothing existed—is exactly what this role seems to need. You're scaling from self-serve to enterprise, which means building new revenue recognition processes, billing workflows, and cross-functional coordination from scratch.

### How do you ensure data accuracy and integrity?

> I'm obsessive about reconciliation. Numbers should tie out, and when they don't, I dig until I find the discrepancy.
>
> My approach:
> 1. **Source of truth**: Identify the authoritative data source and validate everything against it
> 2. **Regular reconciliations**: Don't wait for month-end; catch issues early
> 3. **Automated checks**: Build validation rules into systems so errors are flagged automatically
> 4. **Document assumptions**: When I make judgment calls, I document them so they're auditable
>
> Example: When I automated Salesforce reporting, I built in reconciliation checks that flagged mismatches between CRM data and financial records. That caught data quality issues before they hit financial statements.
>
> In revenue and billing, data integrity is everything. If invoices don't match contracts, or revenue schedules don't align to delivery milestones, you have real problems. I take that seriously.
