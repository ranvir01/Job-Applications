## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this Financial Analyst role at Jamf?

> I'm drawn to this role because it combines core FP&A work—forecasting, budgeting, variance analysis—with a focus area I find compelling: ARR and recognized revenue. I've been doing FP&A work for the past four years, and I want to apply those skills at a company that's building something meaningful.
>
> Jamf's focus on Apple device management puts you at the intersection of enterprise software and a platform people actually love using. The fact that you have 75,000+ customers and a 90% employee retention rate tells me this is a company that takes both its product and its people seriously. That's the kind of environment where I can grow.
>
> I'm also interested in getting exposure to SaaS metrics and recurring revenue models—that's where the industry is heading, and this role would give me that experience while letting me contribute immediately with my existing FP&A skills.

---

### Why Jamf?

> A few things stand out to me about Jamf. First, you're the clear leader in Apple device management—not a company trying to catch up, but one that's defined the category. That kind of market position means the finance team is supporting real growth, not just survival.
>
> Second, the culture emphasis. I saw the awards—Best Companies to Work For, Greatest Workplaces for Mental Well-being—but what actually convinced me was the 90% retention rate. That's not something you can fake. It tells me people want to stay here, which usually means they're treated well and the work is meaningful.
>
> Third, the remote flexibility works for me. I'm based in Seattle, so a Minneapolis-based role with remote options is ideal. I can contribute fully without relocating, and I appreciate that Jamf prioritizes work-life balance.

### Walk me through your FP&A experience

> I have about four years of hands-on FP&A experience across two roles.
>
> Currently, I run an independent consulting practice where I provide financial strategy to multiple clients. My work includes financial modeling, forecasting, and variance analysis. I've delivered valuations up to $1.75M using EBITDA multiples, built executive dashboards, and prepared Board-ready presentations. I also own the weekly forecasting process for one client, working directly with department leaders to update projections.
>
> Before that, I managed financial operations for my family's transportation business. I handled a $1M+ annual operating budget, did monthly P&L reporting, and collaborated with our accountant on month-end close. I automated a lot of our reporting using Excel VBA, which cut manual work by about 80%. I also negotiated contracts that reduced our costs by 10%.
>
> The common thread is taking ownership of the numbers and translating them into insights that drive decisions. That's exactly what this role at Jamf is asking for.

### Tell me about your experience with forecasting and budgeting

> **Situation:** At Thind Transport LLC, we were running the budget on spreadsheets with a lot of manual work. Projections were inconsistent, and we often discovered variances too late to do anything about them.
>
> **Task:** I took ownership of improving our forecasting and budgeting process to make it more accurate and actionable.
>
> **Action:** I rebuilt our budget model in Excel with VBA automation. I set up monthly variance analysis comparing actuals to forecast, and I started tracking key metrics like fuel costs, maintenance expenses, and revenue per truck. I'd review these weekly with my father (the owner) and flag issues before they became problems.
>
> **Result:** We caught cost overruns faster, which helped us reduce operational costs by 10%. Revenue grew 33% over four years partly because we had better visibility into what was working. The automated reports saved about 80% of the time we used to spend on manual data entry.

---

### How do you explain financial concepts to non-financial stakeholders?

> I focus on three things: keep it simple, use visuals, and connect it to what they care about.
>
> For example, when I presented a business valuation to a client, I didn't walk them through every DCF assumption. Instead, I showed them a one-page summary with the valuation range, the key drivers, and what it meant for their exit options. I used a simple chart showing how revenue growth affected the valuation—they could see immediately that a 10% increase in recurring revenue translated to a meaningful bump in value.
>
> The key is knowing your audience. Executives want the "so what"—what should we do about this? Operators want to understand how their decisions affect the numbers. I tailor the message accordingly.

---

### Tell me about a time you identified an insight from data that drove a decision

> **Situation:** While doing financial analysis for Thind Transport, I noticed our maintenance costs were spiking on certain trucks in the fleet.
>
> **Task:** I needed to figure out what was driving the variance and recommend a solution.
>
> **Action:** I pulled three years of maintenance data and built a simple analysis in Excel. I tracked costs by truck, by type of repair, and by age of vehicle. The data showed that trucks over 7 years old were costing us 40% more in maintenance than newer ones—eating into our margins.
>
> **Result:** I presented the findings to my father with a recommendation: sell the two oldest trucks and reinvest in one newer model. We did that, and it reduced our downtime by 15% while cutting maintenance costs. That analysis directly drove an operational decision that improved our bottom line.

### What tools and software are you proficient in?

> My strongest tool is Excel—I use VBA for automation, pivot tables for analysis, and I'm comfortable building complex financial models with multiple scenarios. I've automated reporting processes that used to take hours and turned them into one-click dashboards.
>
> Beyond Excel, I use SQL for querying data directly, which is useful when I need to pull information that's not in a standard report. I've worked with Tableau for visualization and Salesforce for CRM analytics.
>
> I'm a fast learner with new tools. When I started my consulting work, I taught myself enough about Salesforce to automate workflows for a client with 2,000+ accounts. I'd apply that same approach to whatever forecasting and planning tools Jamf uses.
