## 📝 Potential Interview/Screening Questions

### Describe your experience using AI tools in finance work

> I use AI tools daily in my finance consulting work—this isn't theoretical for me.
>
> **Cursor**: My primary development environment for building financial models in Python. I use the AI assistant to write code faster, debug issues, and explore different modeling approaches. For a recent valuation project, I built the entire DCF model with Cursor's help, iterating on the structure and formulas in real-time.
>
> **ChatGPT/Claude**: I use these for rapid research, drafting analysis frameworks, stress-testing assumptions, and getting unstuck on complex problems. When building sensitivity analysis scenarios, I'll prompt Claude to help me think through edge cases I might miss.
>
> **Workflow**: For a recent business valuation ($1.45M-$1.75M), I used AI throughout—researching comparable transactions, building the model, validating calculations, and drafting the executive summary.
>
> I've seen where AI excels (speed, pattern recognition, code generation) and where it struggles (nuanced judgment, context-specific expertise, ambiguous requirements). That dual perspective—power user and critic—is exactly what this role needs.

### What financial modeling experience do you have?

> I've built models across several domains:
>
> **Valuation**: Delivered a business valuation using EBITDA multiples and DCF methodology, projecting a $1.45M–$1.75M range with sensitivity analysis on key drivers.
>
> **Forecasting**: Managed $1M+ annual operating budget with monthly forecasting, variance analysis, and P&L reporting. Built driver-based models that connected operational metrics to financial outcomes.
>
> **Academic**: Built a comprehensive DCF for a $1.737M property with IRR projections and multi-scenario sensitivity analysis. Developed an options strategy for Masimo stock using regression analysis.
>
> **Process**: I don't just build models—I document them. I've created templates, automated workflows (80% time savings with VBA), and trained others on using financial systems.

### How would you translate complex finance concepts into AI-readable formats?

> I think about this in layers:
>
> **1. Define the concept precisely**: What exactly are we teaching the AI? Not "do a DCF" but "calculate the present value of projected free cash flows using a discount rate derived from WACC."
>
> **2. Break into atomic steps**: Each step should have clear inputs, a defined operation, and an expected output. If a step is ambiguous, decompose further.
>
> **3. Specify edge cases**: What happens when revenue is negative? When there's no historical data? AI needs explicit handling for exceptions.
>
> **4. Provide examples**: Show the AI what good looks like—worked examples with inputs and outputs.
>
> **5. Test and iterate**: Prompt the AI, evaluate the output, refine the instructions. Repeat.
>
> This is essentially what I do when building financial models with AI now. I'm constantly refining how I prompt to get better outputs.

### Can you work independently and asynchronously?

> Absolutely—that's how I work now.
>
> I'm an independent consultant managing multiple clients with different timelines and deliverables. I set my own schedule, prioritize work, and deliver without supervision.
>
> For this project:
> - I can commit to 10+ hours/week with flexibility on when those hours happen
> - I'm comfortable with asynchronous communication—clear written updates, documentation, and deliverables
> - I'm self-directed and don't need hand-holding
>
> I also have experience working remotely with distributed teams and async collaboration.

### Why are you interested in this opportunity?

> Three reasons:
>
> **1. I'm already doing this**: I use AI daily to build financial models. Creating structured guides to make AI better at finance is a natural extension of what I do.
>
> **2. The intersection matters**: AI is transforming finance, and I want to be part of shaping how it evolves. Teaching AI to reason about financial concepts correctly—that has real impact.
>
> **3. The structure fits**: Project-based, flexible hours, high compensation, remote. It complements my consulting work perfectly.
>
> Plus, Mercor partners with leading AI labs. The opportunity to work with frontier models and AI researchers is genuinely exciting.
