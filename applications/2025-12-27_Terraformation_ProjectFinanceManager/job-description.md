## 🎯 Match Analysis

### My Matching Qualifications
- ✅ **Bachelor's in Finance** – BA Business Administration with Finance concentration
- ✅ **Financial modeling** – DCF, valuations, scenario analysis, risk quantification
- ✅ **Cross-functional coordination** – Worked with accounting, operations, leadership, clients

- ✅ **Attention to detail** – Variance analysis, reconciliations, financial reporting
- ✅ **Communication** – Executive presentations, stakeholder management

### Gaps to Address
- ⚠️ **No formal project finance experience** – Frame consulting valuations as related but acknowledge gap
- ⚠️ **No renewable energy/forestry/carbon experience** – Emphasize transferable financial skills and climate interest
- ⚠️ **No transaction execution experience** – This is a senior role requiring deal execution background
- ⚠️ **No investor-facing deal experience** – Client presentations exist but not capital raising

---

## ⚠️ Honest Assessment

This role requires **senior project finance experience** that you don't have:
- Transaction execution from term sheet to close
- Investor-facing responsibilities
- Project finance in natural resources/renewables/carbon

**This may be a stretch application.** Your financial modeling and FP&A skills transfer, but the core project finance execution experience is missing.

**Consider if**:
- You're genuinely interested in climate/forestry and willing to grow into the role
- You can position your valuation and consulting work as relevant transaction experience
- You're okay with potentially being screened out due to experience gap

## 💡 Application Strategy (If Proceeding)

### Resume Focus Areas
- **Financial modeling** – Valuations, risk analysis, scenario modeling
- **Transaction-adjacent experience** – Business valuation, due diligence-style analysis
- **Stakeholder coordination** – Cross-functional collaboration, client management
- **Contract negotiation** – Vendor negotiations, cost reduction
- **Climate/mission interest** – If genuine, mention in cover letter

### Key Selling Points
1. **Strong financial modeling** – DCF, sensitivity analysis, risk quantification
2. **Valuation experience** – $1.45M-$1.75M valuation is transaction-adjacent
3. **Cross-functional coordination** – Managing multiple stakeholders
4. **Remote-ready** – Already working remotely
5. **Mission alignment** – Climate solution work is meaningful
