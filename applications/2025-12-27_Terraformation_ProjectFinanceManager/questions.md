## ⚠️ Honest Gap Assessment

This role requires **senior project finance execution experience** that I don't have directly:

| Requirement | My Status |
|-------------|-----------|
| Project finance transaction execution | ❌ No direct experience |
| Term sheet to close experience | ❌ No direct experience |
| Investor-facing responsibilities | ⚠️ Limited – client presentations but not capital raising |
| Financial modeling / risk quantification | ✅ Strong – DCF, valuations, scenario analysis |
| Contract negotiation | ⚠️ Vendor negotiations, not project finance documents |
| Cross-functional coordination | ✅ Strong – multiple stakeholders, deadlines |
| Natural resources/renewables/carbon | ❌ No direct experience |

**This is a stretch application.** I'm applying because:
1. The mission is compelling (climate/forestry)
2. My financial modeling and coordination skills transfer
3. I'm willing to grow into the role

## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this Project Finance Manager role at Terraformation?

> Two things drew me to this role:
>
> First, the mission. Climate change is the defining challenge of our generation, and forest restoration is a solution that's tangible, scientifically grounded, and economically viable. Terraformation's approach—native forests, community benefits, high-quality carbon—aligns with what I believe effective climate action looks like.
>
> Second, the work. Project finance execution combines the analytical rigor I love (financial modeling, risk quantification) with the coordination and deal-making that I find energizing. While my background is in FP&A and consulting rather than formal project finance, I've done related work: business valuations, due diligence-style analysis, contract negotiations, and multi-stakeholder coordination.
>
> I'm honest about the experience gap, but I'm a fast learner with strong fundamentals who's motivated by the mission.

### What project finance experience do you have?

> I should be transparent: I don't have formal project finance transaction experience. What I do have is adjacent experience:
>
> **Valuation and due diligence**: I delivered a $1.45M–$1.75M business valuation that required gathering financial data, analyzing risk, building models, and presenting findings to stakeholders. While not a capital raise, it involved similar analytical rigor.
>
> **Contract negotiation**: At Thind Transport, I negotiated vendor contracts, achieving 10% cost reduction through terms optimization and risk allocation. Different context than project finance documents, but the negotiation discipline transfers.
>
> **Cross-functional coordination**: I've managed projects with multiple stakeholders—accounting, operations, external partners—under deadline pressure. That coordination skill is central to transaction execution.
>
> I'd be learning the specific mechanics of project finance deals on the job, but I bring strong financial modeling, attention to detail, and the drive to get up to speed quickly.

### Describe your experience with financial modeling and risk quantification

> Financial modeling is one of my core strengths:
>
> **Business valuation**: Built a DCF and EBITDA-multiple valuation with sensitivity analysis on key assumptions. The model quantified how changes in revenue growth, margins, and discount rate affected the valuation range.
>
> **Scenario analysis**: For client forecasts, I build models with multiple scenarios (base, upside, downside) that quantify the financial impact of different assumptions.
>
> **Risk quantification**: My approach is to identify the key variables, model their range of outcomes, and show stakeholders what drives risk. For example, in fleet operations, I modeled how fuel price volatility and route efficiency affected profitability.
>
> I'm comfortable building models from scratch and interpreting existing models to support decision-making.

### How do you handle coordination across multiple stakeholders under deadline pressure?

> This is how I've worked for the past four years.
>
> In my consulting work, I manage multiple client engagements simultaneously—each with different stakeholders, timelines, and deliverables. The keys:
>
> 1. **Clear communication**: Set expectations early, update frequently, flag risks proactively
> 2. **Prioritization**: Know what's critical path and protect it
> 3. **Documentation**: Track everything so nothing falls through the cracks
> 4. **Adaptability**: Deals evolve; I adjust and keep moving
>
> At Thind Transport, I coordinated vendor agreements and operational projects with tight deadlines. I managed the process, tracked action items, and ensured we closed on time.
>
> I thrive under deadline pressure—it focuses me.

---

### What interests you about climate and forestry?

> I'm genuinely motivated by work that matters beyond the numbers.
>
> Climate change is the biggest challenge of our time, and I've been following the carbon markets and nature-based solutions space. What draws me to Terraformation specifically is the focus on native, biodiverse forests—not monoculture plantations that check a box but don't deliver real ecological benefit.
>
> The combination of rigorous project finance and meaningful climate impact is rare. I want my financial skills to contribute to something I believe in.
