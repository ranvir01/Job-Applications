## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this Executive Assistant role at Nordstrom?

> A few things stand out:
>
> First, the Finance connection. I have a finance background—BA in Business Administration with a Finance concentration from UW Foster. Supporting SVPs and VPs in the Finance organization means I can add value beyond typical administrative support. I understand budgets, expense reconciliations, and financial presentations because I've built them myself.
>
> Second, the coordination aspect. I've spent years managing multiple projects, stakeholders, and deadlines simultaneously. In my consulting work, I coordinate activities across clients, prepare executive presentations, and ensure things run smoothly. That translates directly to this role.
>
> Third, Nordstrom. It's a Seattle institution with a reputation for excellent customer service. I'd be proud to work here and contribute to that legacy.

### Describe your experience managing complex calendars and coordinating across teams

> In my current consulting work, I manage engagements with multiple clients—each with different timelines, meetings, and deliverables. I've developed systems to track commitments, anticipate conflicts, and proactively communicate.
>
> At Thind Transport, I coordinated activities across operations, maintenance, and admin teams. I managed scheduling for 10-20 operators and employees, coordinating routes, availability, and compliance deadlines. When conflicts arose, I prioritized, communicated, and found solutions.
>
> My approach:
> 1. **Anticipate**: Look ahead for conflicts before they happen
> 2. **Prioritize**: Know what's most important and protect that time
> 3. **Communicate**: Keep everyone informed, especially when things change
> 4. **Document**: Maintain clear records so nothing falls through the cracks

### Tell me about a time you improved a process

> At Thind Transport, our monthly financial reporting was entirely manual—gathering data, building spreadsheets, formatting reports. It took days each month.
>
> I redesigned the process using Excel VBA automation:
> - Created automated data pulls
> - Built dynamic dashboards that updated automatically
> - Standardized report formats
>
> The result was an **80% reduction in reporting time**. What took days became hours. I also documented the process so it wasn't dependent on me.
>
> I apply this mindset everywhere. When I see repetitive work, I ask: "Can this be automated or streamlined?" Usually the answer is yes.

### How do you handle changing priorities and multiple demands?

> Flexibility is essential in my current work. I manage multiple client engagements with different needs and timelines. Priorities shift constantly.
>
> My approach:
> 1. **Clarify urgency**: Is this actually urgent, or just new?
> 2. **Communicate trade-offs**: If I prioritize X, Y will be delayed. Is that okay?
> 3. **Stay organized**: I use tracking systems so I never lose sight of commitments
> 4. **Don't over-promise**: I set realistic expectations and then exceed them
>
> For example, when a client needed an urgent deliverable while I was mid-project for another, I communicated with both, adjusted timelines, and delivered both successfully. The key was transparency.

### How do you build relationships with executives and stakeholders?

> I've worked with executives and leadership throughout my career—preparing presentations, delivering insights, and supporting their decision-making.
>
> My approach:
> 1. **Anticipate their needs**: Don't wait to be asked; proactively prepare what they'll need
> 2. **Be reliable**: Do what I say I'll do, when I say I'll do it
> 3. **Communicate clearly**: Executives are busy; get to the point
> 4. **Protect their time**: Shield them from unnecessary details while keeping them informed on what matters
>
> Trust is built through consistent, reliable execution over time. That's what I focus on.

---

### What experience do you have with budgets and expense reconciliations?

> I've managed budgets and reconciliations directly:
>
> At Thind Transport, I managed a **$1M+ annual operating budget**. This included expense tracking, variance analysis, and monthly reconciliations. I ensured expenses were properly categorized, matched to supporting documentation, and flagged discrepancies for review.
>
> In my consulting work, I maintain client budgets and perform reconciliations as part of financial reporting. I'm comfortable with the process—tracking expenses, comparing to budget, investigating variances, and ensuring accuracy.
>
> I also have advanced Excel skills, which makes reconciliation work efficient.
