# ❓ Application Questions: Microsoft Finance Manager – Minecraft ROB

---

## 📋 Application Form Questions

### Why Microsoft / Xbox Game Studios?

I've followed Microsoft's growth in gaming, from the Xbox ecosystem to the Activision acquisition. Mojang and Minecraft represent something unique—a game that's become a cultural institution with 300M+ copies sold. The opportunity to support Minecraft's P&L while learning gaming economics is exactly the kind of high-impact finance role I'm looking for. Microsoft's growth mindset culture also resonates with how I approach my work—always looking for ways to improve processes and deliver better insights.

### Why this Finance Manager role?

This role combines what I do best—FP&A, business partnering, and data-driven analysis—with an industry I find genuinely exciting. I've led month-end close processes, built forecasting models, and partnered cross-functionally to translate financial data into business decisions. The Rhythm of Business framework at Microsoft aligns with how I already structure my work: monthly discipline, quarterly strategy, and long-range planning. I want to bring that rigor to Mojang Studios.

### Tell me about yourself (2-minute version)

I graduated from UW Foster in 2024 with a Finance degree and 4+ years of hands-on FP&A experience. Currently at MyConsulting Network, I lead forecasting and close processes for multiple clients—most recently delivering a business valuation in the $1.45M-$1.75M range using EBITDA multiples. Before that, I managed the full P&L for a transportation company: monthly close, quarterly forecasts, annual budgets. I automated our reporting process with Excel VBA, cutting time by 80% and enabling real-time variance tracking.

What I bring is a combination of technical depth (Excel, SQL, Tableau) and business partnering experience. I've worked cross-functionally with operations, accounting, and leadership to ensure our financial planning aligned with business goals. I'm ready to apply that to Xbox Game Studios and learn the economics of gaming.

## 🎯 Behavioral Questions (STAR Format)

### ROB Experience: Tell me about leading a rhythm of business process

**Situation:** At Thind Transport, we had no formal financial planning cadence—everything was reactive.

**Task:** Establish a structured process for monthly close, quarterly forecasts, and annual budgeting.

**Action:** I created a calendar for the close process, defined ownership for each step, and built templates for variance analysis. Partnered with operations to get timely data. For quarterly forecasts, I met with department leads to update assumptions. Built dashboards that tracked KPIs so leadership could see performance in real-time.

**Result:** Reduced close time significantly and caught variances early—like a fuel cost overrun that we addressed before quarter-end. The structured approach enabled better decision-making and eventually led to the 10% cost reduction through renegotiated contracts.

### Business Partnering: Tell me about translating financial data for stakeholders

**Situation:** At MyConsulting, I was preparing a business valuation for Tabletop Village LLC. The owners weren't finance people—they needed to understand the valuation to make a strategic decision about selling.

**Task:** Deliver a valuation that was defensible but also explainable to non-financial stakeholders.

**Action:** I built the EBITDA-based model with sensitivity analysis showing the range of outcomes ($1.45M-$1.75M). But instead of just presenting numbers, I created a visual summary showing what drove the valuation and what assumptions mattered most. Walked them through scenarios: "If revenue grows 5% vs. stays flat, here's the impact."

**Result:** The owners understood not just the number but the drivers behind it. They used the analysis for strategic planning discussions with potential buyers. The process taught me that great finance work isn't just accurate—it's actionable.

---

### Excel Proficiency: Tell me about using Excel to drive business outcomes

**Situation:** At Thind Transport, monthly P&L reporting took 8+ hours because everything was manual—pulling data from multiple sources, consolidating, formatting.

**Task:** Reduce reporting time while maintaining accuracy and enabling better analysis.

**Action:** I rebuilt the entire process using Excel with VBA automation. Created dynamic dashboards that pulled from centralized data, automated variance calculations with formulas, and built conditional formatting to flag issues. Used Pivot Tables to slice data by cost category, time period, and department.

**Result:** Cut reporting time from 8+ hours to under 2 hours—an 80% reduction. More importantly, the automated variance tracking enabled real-time insights. We identified a fuel cost overrun early enough to renegotiate a vendor contract, saving 10% on that expense category.

---

### Data Integrity: Tell me about ensuring accuracy and compliance

**Situation:** At MyConsulting, I was automating Salesforce CRM workflows for a firm managing 2,000+ client accounts. The existing data had inconsistencies that would break the automation.

**Task:** Clean the data, establish governance, and ensure ongoing accuracy.

**Action:** I audited the existing records, identified patterns in the errors, and created validation rules to prevent future issues. Built reconciliation reports that flagged discrepancies. Documented the data hierarchy and trained the team on proper entry procedures. Established regular data quality checks as part of the monthly process.

**Result:** Improved data accuracy by 30%. The automation ran reliably, and the firm now has ongoing governance processes. This taught me that data integrity isn't a one-time fix—it's an ongoing discipline.

---

### Fast-Paced Environment: Tell me about managing multiple priorities

**Situation:** At MyConsulting, I'm juggling multiple client engagements simultaneously—each with their own timelines and deliverables.

**Task:** Deliver quality work across all clients without dropping anything.

**Action:** I prioritize ruthlessly based on deadlines and impact. Use a tracking system to see all active projects at a glance. For each client, I set expectations upfront about timelines. When conflicts arise, I communicate early and propose alternatives. I also look for efficiencies—templates and processes that can apply across multiple engagements.

**Result:** Haven't missed a client deadline. The structured approach actually creates capacity—I can take on more because I'm organized. It's also why I automated so much at Thind Transport; automation frees you up for higher-value work.

---

### Gaming/Entertainment Interest: Why gaming finance?

**Situation:** I've been gaming since childhood—Minecraft was actually one of the first games I played extensively. But I also recognize that gaming is a massive business with complex economics.

**Task:** Connect my finance skills to an industry I genuinely care about.

**Action:** I've followed the gaming industry through acquisitions (Microsoft-Activision), subscription models (Game Pass), and the shift to live service games. I understand that gaming finance involves unique challenges: unpredictable release cycles, monetization strategy, platform economics, and content costs.

**Result:** This role would let me apply my FP&A experience to an industry I understand as both a consumer and an analyst. I'm not just interested in gaming—I want to understand the economics deeply enough to influence decisions.
