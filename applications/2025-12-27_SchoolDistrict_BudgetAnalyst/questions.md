## 📝 Potential Interview Questions & Answers

### Why are you interested in this Budget Analyst role?

> A few things drew me to this position:
>
> First, the work itself. Budget analysis, monitoring compliance, reconciling accounts, designing spreadsheets, and providing training to staff—that's exactly what I've been doing for the past four years. The role aligns closely with my experience.
>
> Second, the public service aspect. Supporting a school district means my work contributes to education and the community. That's meaningful in a way that's different from private sector work.
>
> Third, the structure. Working with limited supervision while being held responsible for results matches how I operate. I'm a self-starter who takes ownership.

### Describe your experience with budget analysis and monitoring

> Budget analysis has been central to my work:
>
> At Thind Transport, I monitored a **$1M+ annual operating budget**, tracking actual expenditures against the adopted budget. I:
> - Identified variances and investigated the causes
> - Reported significant deviations to leadership
> - Reconciled budget accounts monthly
> - Ensured compliance with budget allocations
>
> In my consulting work, I continue this—monitoring program budgets for clients, projecting revenues and expenditures, and identifying budget issues before they become problems.
>
> I understand the importance of compliance and accuracy in budget work.

---

### Tell me about your experience with journal entries and reconciliations

> I've worked closely with accounting on month-end processes:
>
> - **Journal entries**: Recorded accruals and adjusting entries for expenses not yet invoiced
> - **Reconciliations**: Ensured budget accounts tied to supporting documentation and transaction records
> - **Transaction analysis**: Reviewed transactions for proper coding and accuracy
> - **Variance investigation**: When actuals didn't match budget, I investigated and resolved discrepancies
>
> At Thind Transport, I partnered with accounting monthly on close activities. I understand the importance of accurate records and proper documentation.

---

### Describe your Excel skills and experience designing spreadsheets

> Excel is my primary tool, and I'm advanced:
>
> - **VBA automation**: Built macros that automated monthly reporting, reducing time by 80%
> - **Advanced formulas**: VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, SUMIFS, nested IFs, array formulas
> - **Pivot Tables**: For analyzing budget data by department, account code, period
> - **Dashboard design**: Created executive-ready layouts for budget monitoring
> - **Data validation**: Input controls to prevent errors
>
> I've designed spreadsheets specifically for budget monitoring—tracking actuals vs. budget, calculating variances, flagging issues. I can build tools to meet the district's specific needs.

---

### Have you provided training or technical advice to staff?

> Yes, this has been part of my work:
>
> At Thind Transport, when I built new reporting tools, I:
> - Documented the processes clearly
> - Trained team members on how to use the systems
> - Answered questions and provided ongoing support
> - Updated documentation as processes changed
>
> In consulting, I regularly explain financial concepts to non-finance stakeholders. I can translate technical budget information into terms that program staff understand.
>
> I believe good training documentation is essential—if I'm unavailable, others should be able to continue the work.

### You don't have public school experience. How would you get up to speed?

> You're right—I don't have direct public school or grant management experience. But I bring transferable skills:
>
> - **Budget monitoring and compliance**: The discipline is the same whether it's a business budget or a grant budget
> - **Accounting fundamentals**: Journal entries, reconciliations, chart of accounts
> - **Regulatory reporting**: I've worked with compliance requirements in operations
>
> To get up to speed quickly, I would:
> 1. Study OSPI reporting requirements and the school district's chart of accounts
> 2. Shadow experienced staff to understand current workflows
> 3. Review past grant budgets and compliance documentation
> 4. Ask questions—lots of them
>
> I'm a fast learner with strong fundamentals. The technical skills transfer; the specific context, I'll learn.
