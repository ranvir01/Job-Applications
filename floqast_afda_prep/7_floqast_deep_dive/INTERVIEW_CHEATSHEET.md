I'm excited about FloQast because it's at the intersection of accounting, automation, and customer impact - exactly where I thrive."

---

## Why FloQast? (30 seconds)

## Gap-Owning (Be Authentic)

### "You don't have a CPA?"
> "Correct - I don't. I have a Finance degree with accounting coursework, plus hands-on close experience. I'm interested in pursuing the CPA. For this role, the value is in bridging accounting knowledge and technical implementation - I have both."

### "No public accounting experience?"
> "True - I have operations support experience, not Big 4. What I bring: understanding of workflows, automation expertise, customer-facing skills. I haven't prepared audited financials, but I've done the workflows FloQast automates. I'll learn from diverse customers."

### "No NetSuite/Intacct experience?"
> "Correct - I have Salesforce experience (similar concepts: API integration, data sync, troubleshooting). I'm a quick learner - taught myself VBA, Python, SQL. I'll work with customers' ERP admins and become an integration expert quickly."

### "Resume emphasis vs. actual role?"
> "Fair observation. At Thind Transport, I supported the close - I didn't own it. I did journal entries, reconciliations, variance analysis. Support-level experience with core workflows, plus automation mindset. That's what FloQast needs for this role."
