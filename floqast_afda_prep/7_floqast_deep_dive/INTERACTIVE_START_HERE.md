## Quick Reference: Key Interview Answers

### "Walk me through a journal entry you've created"
> "At Thind Transport, I handled month-end accruals. For example, when we had fleet maintenance done in December but the invoice came in January, I'd create an accrual entry: Debit Maintenance Expense $12,500, Credit Accrued Liabilities $12,500. Then in January when the invoice arrived, I'd reverse it and record the actual payment. This ensured our December financials were accurate for the close."

### "Tell me about your automation experience"
> "At Thind Transport, I automated our monthly reporting with VBA, reducing the process from 8 hours to 1.5 hours - an 80% time savings. I also used ChatGPT and Cursor AI in my consulting work to build financial models that delivered 15-20% returns. Similar to how FloQast's Transform AI Agents automate workflows, I'm passionate about eliminating repetitive manual work."

### "I notice you don't have a CPA" (Gap-Owning)
> "You're right - I don't have my CPA yet. What I bring is a hybrid skillset: solid accounting fundamentals from UW Foster and hands-on month-end close experience, combined with technical automation skills I taught myself. I'm eager to grow into deeper accounting expertise, which is why FloQast's 'Empowered to Grow' value resonates with me. The AFDA role is a perfect fit because it values both accounting knowledge AND the ability to configure technical solutions."

## What Makes This Different

**OLD approach**: Watch code run simulations  
**NEW approach**: YOU do the work, AI validates

- You CREATE journal entries → AI checks if balanced
- You CONFIGURE agents → AI validates logic
- You SOLVE customer problems → AI evaluates approach
- You ANSWER interview questions → AI acts as interviewer
