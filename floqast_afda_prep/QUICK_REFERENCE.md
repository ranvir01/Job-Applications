## 🎤 Opening Statement (15 seconds)

> "I'm Ranvir Thind, Finance grad from UW Foster with hands-on accounting experience in month-end close, reconciliations, and variance analysis. I've automated financial workflows—achieving 80% time savings with VBA—and I use AI tools daily. I'm excited about FloQast because it's at the intersection of accounting, automation, and customer impact, which is exactly where I thrive."

## 🔑 Gap-Owning Responses (Quick)

**"You don't have a CPA"**
> "Correct - I have a Finance degree with accounting coursework plus hands-on close experience. For the AFDA role, the value is bridging accounting knowledge and technical implementation - I have both."

**"No public accounting"**
> "True - I have operations support experience, not Big 4. What I bring: understanding of workflows, automation expertise, customer-facing skills. I'll learn from diverse customers."

**"No NetSuite/Intacct"**
> "Correct - I have Salesforce experience with similar concepts: API integration, data sync, troubleshooting. I'm a quick learner—taught myself VBA, Python, SQL."

## 🎯 Technical Explanations (30-second versions)

### Bank Reconciliation
> "Two-column approach: Start with GL cash balance on one side, bank statement balance on the other. Adjust GL for bank charges and interest not recorded. Adjust bank balance for deposits in transit and outstanding checks. Both adjusted balances should match. This is what FloQast's AutoRec automates with configurable matching rules."

### Journal Entry
> "When we received fleet maintenance in December for $12,500 but the invoice came in January, I created an accrual entry: Debit Maintenance Expense $12,500, Credit Accrued Liabilities $12,500. This ensures December expenses match December activities—the matching principle. Transform AI Agents can automate these accrual entries based on configurable rules."

### Variance Analysis
> "Compare actuals to budget or prior month. Identify material variances—greater than 10% or $5,000. Break down drivers: Is it volume, price, or timing? For example, if fuel increased 29%, determine if it's from more miles driven or higher gas prices. FloQast's Flux AI automates this analysis and generates narratives."

### Month-End Close
> "Day 1-3: Accrue expenses for services received but not invoiced. Day 4-5: Bank reconciliations. Day 6: Depreciation. Day 7: Variance analysis. Day 8-10: Financial statement review. FloQast's Close product manages this workflow, tracking status and dependencies."

## 🛡️ Handling Objections

**"I don't trust AI with accounting"**
> "Valid concern - accuracy is critical. Transform AI Agents aren't replacing judgment, they're automating tedious parts. YOU configure the rules, YOU set thresholds, YOU review outputs before posting. It's like Excel formulas - you wouldn't manually sum 500 cells, but you DO review the formula."

**"This seems expensive"**
> "Let's look at ROI: If your team spends 15 hours per month on variance analysis, and Flux reduces that to 2 hours, that's 13 hours saved × $80/hour = $15,600/year. Plus faster close means earlier insights for decision-making. Customers typically see 20% faster close cycles."

**"Our workflows are too complex to automate"**
> "That's actually where Transform AI shines - complex, unique workflows. The natural language builder lets you configure agents for YOUR specific process, not a one-size-fits-all solution. We'd start with one high-volume, low-complexity workflow to prove value, then expand."
