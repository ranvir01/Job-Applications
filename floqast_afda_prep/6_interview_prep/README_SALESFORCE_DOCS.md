## 🎤 The Power Phrase (Use This Verbatim)

> "I came in, saw a Salesforce that was slow and full of noise. Lead conversion was broken—description field disappeared, UserID wasn't passed, button didn't even show. I rebuilt the flow from scratch, remapped the fields, made sure leads converted cleanly to opportunities. Then I cleaned 700 duplicates, built automated task creation so every lead got instant follow-up, and created real-time dashboards for the CFO. Result: 95% conversion rate, zero manual tasks, real-time reporting. No dev background—just logic, curiosity, and not accepting 'that's how it works.' That's the same approach I'd bring to FloQast AI Agents."
