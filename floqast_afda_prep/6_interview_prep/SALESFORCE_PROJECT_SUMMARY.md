## 🗣️ How to Tell This Story in Interviews

### The Narrative (60 seconds):
> "I consulted for AI-Driven Business Growth, where their Salesforce instance was broken. Lead-to-opportunity conversion didn't work—fields disappeared, UserID wasn't passed, the button didn't even show. Sales reps were manually copying data. I rebuilt the entire flow from scratch, remapped all the fields, and tested edge cases until it worked reliably—95% completion rate.
>
> Then I cleaned the data—700+ duplicate leads and contacts were making reports unreliable. I used mass merge to consolidate them without losing any relationships or data.
>
> After that, I built automation. Every time a lead comes in, a task automatically appears for the sales rep with pre-filled context—'Send intro email to [Lead Name].' No more excuses for not following up.
>
> Finally, I built a real-time dashboard for the CFO—pipeline by week, color-coded by win-rate. No more static spreadsheets.
>
> Total time: 30 hours. No dev background—I taught myself using ChatGPT and Cursor. That's proof I can learn technical systems fast and deliver impact."
