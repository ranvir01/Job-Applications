## FloQast Values-Based Questions {#floqast-values}

### 1. "Tell me about a time you had to be unwaveringly authentic, even when it was difficult"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: At Thind Transport, I was preparing monthly financial reports for leadership
- **Task**: I discovered that our fuel expense variance was significantly unfavorable (20% over budget)
- **Action**: Instead of downplaying it, I presented the full picture to management with detailed drivers: price increases and additional route miles. I recommended immediate actions: renegotiating fuel contracts and optimizing routes
- **Result**: Management appreciated the honesty. We implemented my recommendations and reduced fuel costs by 8% over the next quarter

**Gap-Owning Addition**:
> "This reflects FloQast's value of Unwaveringly Authentic. I believe in being transparent about challenges, which is especially important in this role when I need to tell customers honestly what FloQast can and cannot do for them."

### 2. "Give an example of when you showed ambition with integrity"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: In consulting, a client asked me to deliver financial projections in 2 days
- **Task**: The timeline was aggressive, and I could have cut corners to meet it
- **Action**: I told the client honestly that a quality analysis would take 4 days, but I could provide preliminary insights in 2 days with final recommendations following. I worked extra hours to deliver both
- **Result**: Client appreciated the transparency. The preliminary insights were immediately actionable, and the final analysis became their strategic roadmap

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "As an AFDA, I'll be ambitious in helping customers achieve results quickly, but I won't overpromise on what an agent can do. Integrity means setting realistic expectations."

---

### 3. "Describe a time you empowered yourself to grow and learn something new"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: At Thind Transport, our monthly reporting was entirely manual (Excel-based)
- **Task**: I wanted to automate it but had no VBA programming experience
- **Action**: I self-taught VBA using online resources (YouTube, Stack Overflow). Spent evenings and weekends building automated reporting macros. Iterated through 10+ versions based on user feedback
- **Result**: **80% time savings** on monthly reporting. What took 8 hours now took 1.5 hours

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "This embodies 'Empowered to Grow.' I won't wait for formal training - I'll dive into FloQast's platform, learn the agent builder, and become an expert quickly. I thrive on self-directed learning."

---

### 4. "Tell me about a successful collaboration with a difficult stakeholder"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: While consulting, I worked with a client's IT director who was skeptical of Salesforce automation
- **Task**: Needed his buy-in to access CRM data and configure workflows
- **Action**: Instead of pushing my solution, I scheduled a discovery call to understand his concerns (security, data integrity). I addressed each concern with specific safeguards. I involved him in the configuration process and gave him final approval on each step
- **Result**: He became my advocate. He presented our Salesforce automation to other departments as a model. The project scaled from 2,000 to 5,000+ accounts

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "Collaboration is key as an AFDA. I'll work with customers' ERP admins, accounting teams, and IT - each with different priorities. Building trust through listening is how I'll succeed."

---

### 5. "Give an example of being customer obsessed"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: A consulting client's Salesforce reports were showing incorrect data
- **Task**: I could have just fixed the technical issue
- **Action**: I dug deeper - WHY were they looking at this data? What decisions were they making? I discovered they needed real-time visibility into account health. I built a custom dashboard with proactive alerts for at-risk accounts
- **Result**: Not only fixed the bug, but delivered a solution they didn't know they needed. Client renewed contract and referred me to two other businesses

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "Customer obsession means going beyond 'configure the agent.' It means understanding the customer's business pain and ensuring FloQast solves it completely. That's how I'll drive adoption and renewals."

## Accounting Experience Questions {#accounting-experience}

### 6. "Walk me through your accounting close experience" ⚠️ GAP-OWNING CRITICAL

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: At Thind Transport, I supported month-end close for a $1M+ budget
- **Task**: My role was to assist with close tasks, not own the full close (being transparent)
- **Action**: I handled:
  - Recording journal entries (accruals, prepayments, depreciation)
  - Account reconciliations (bank, fuel cards, vendor statements)
  - Variance analysis (budget vs actual, period-over-period)
  - Preparing management reports with explanations
- **Result**: Consistent, clean monthly closes. Management had insights to make decisions

**GAP-OWNING** (CRITICAL - BE HONEST):
> "I want to be transparent - this was an **operations support role**, not a public accounting position. I didn't own the full close or prepare audited financials. 
>
> What I bring is:
> 1. **Understanding of the workflows** - I've done journal entries, reconciliations, variance analysis
> 2. **Automation mindset** - I see where manual processes can be streamlined
> 3. **Eagerness to learn** - The AFDA role excites me because it's about deploying automation tools for these exact workflows
>
> I haven't worked at a Big 4 firm, but I have hands-on experience with the core accounting processes FloQast automates. And I'm excited to learn from customers with deeper accounting expertise."

### 7. "How do you perform variance analysis?"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: Monthly at Thind Transport, I analyzed P&L vs budget
- **Task**: Identify material variances and explain drivers to management
- **Action**: Process:
  1. Calculate $ and % variance for each account
  2. Apply materiality thresholds (>10% or >$5,000)
  3. Investigate drivers (e.g., fuel spike due to price increase)
  4. Prepare narrative explanations
  5. Present to leadership with actionable recommendations
- **Result**: Management used insights for cost control decisions (e.g., fuel contract renegotiation)

**Connection to FloQast**:
> "This directly maps to FloQast's 'Flux' variance explainer agent. What I did manually in 3-4 hours, the agent can automate - calculating variances, flagging material items, and generating draft narratives. I'd configure it with the customer's materiality thresholds and train it on their typical variance drivers."

---

### 8. "Describe your experience with account reconciliations"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: Monthly bank reconciliations for Thind Transport's operating account
- **Task**: Ensure GL cash balance ties to bank statement
- **Action**:
  - Downloaded bank statement and GL cash ledger
  - Matched transactions (manual vlookup in Excel)
  - Identified reconciling items (deposits in transit, outstanding checks, bank fees)
  - Prepared reconciliation summary for management review
- **Result**: Clean reconciliations every month. Typical time: 4-5 hours

**Connection to FloQast**:
> "FloQast's AutoRec would have saved me 60% of that time. The manual matching (vlookup) is exactly what the agent automates. As an AFDA, I'd configure the matching rules (exact match, fuzzy date match) and train the customer on reviewing exceptions. That's my value - I've done it manually, so I understand the pain points."

---

## Automation & Technical Questions {#automation-technical}

### 9. "Tell me about your most impactful automation project"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: Thind Transport's monthly financial reporting was 100% manual
- **Task**: Leadership needed reports faster with less effort
- **Action**:
  - Mapped the current process (8 hours of work)
  - Identified automatable steps (data pulls, calculations, formatting)
  - Built Excel VBA macros: automated data pulls from accounting system, dynamic dashboards, one-click report generation
  - Tested with 3 months of historical data
  - Trained team on using the new system
  - Documented the process
- **Result**: **80% time savings** - 8 hours → 1.5 hours. Freed up time for analysis instead of data entry

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "This is EXACTLY what I'll do as an AFDA, but with FloQast's tools. Understand manual process, configure automation, test, train, document. The only difference is I'll use FloQast's agent builder instead of VBA. The methodology is the same."

---

### 10. "Describe your experience with AI tools"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: In 2023, I started using ChatGPT and Cursor AI for financial modeling
- **Task**: Wanted to work more efficiently and learn new skills
- **Action**:
  - Use ChatGPT daily for: rapid research, debugging Excel formulas, brainstorming approaches
  - Use Cursor for: building Python financial models with AI assistance
  - Example: Built a DCF model in Python (would have taken me 3 days manually, took 1 day with AI)
- **Result**: Consulting clients get **15-20% better returns** because I can iterate models faster

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "I'm already using AI for finance work. FloQast's Transform AI Agents are the next evolution - applying AI to accounting workflows at scale. I understand the human-in-the-loop concept: AI does heavy lifting, accountant reviews and approves. That's how I use ChatGPT now."

---

### 11. "How do you troubleshoot technical issues?"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: Salesforce automation I built for a client stopped working - reports showing blank data
- **Task**: Diagnose and fix quickly (client needs daily reports)
- **Action**: Systematic approach:
  1. Check the error logs (Salesforce debug logs)
  2. Isolate the issue (which step in the workflow failed?)
  3. Test with sample data (can I reproduce the error?)
  4. Research (Google, Salesforce community, documentation)
  5. Implement fix and validate
  6. Document root cause for future reference
- **Result**: Fixed within 2 hours. Prevented future occurrences by adding validation rules

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "When a customer says 'the Coupa accrual agent isn't working,' I'll use this same systematic approach: check logs, isolate the issue (data source? configuration?), test, research, fix, document. I'm comfortable with technical troubleshooting."

---

## Customer-Facing Questions {#customer-facing}

### 12. "Tell me about a time you had to explain a complex technical concept to a non-technical audience"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: Client asked how Salesforce automation would work
- **Task**: Explain technical workflow without jargon
- **Action**: Used analogy: "Think of it like autopilot in a car. You set the destination (your business rules), and the system handles the repetitive driving (data entry, report generation). You're still in control and can take over anytime."
  - Drew a simple flowchart showing: Trigger → Action → Result
  - Showed before/after examples
  - Answered questions in plain language
- **Result**: Client understood immediately. Approved project on the spot

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "I'll do this constantly as an AFDA. Explaining to accountants how agents work, to IT teams how the integration works, to executives what the ROI is. I translate technical concepts to match my audience."

---

### 13. "Describe a time you had to manage a difficult customer situation"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: Consulting client was frustrated - expected results in 2 weeks, project took 4 weeks
- **Task**: Salvage the relationship and deliver value
- **Action**:
  - Acknowledged their frustration (didn't make excuses)
  - Explained the root cause transparently (data quality issues we discovered)
  - Showed the extra value we delivered (not just what they asked for, but what they needed)
  - Offered office hours for follow-up questions
- **Result**: Client appreciated the honesty. They renewed the contract and referred me to another business. Turned a frustrated customer into an advocate

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "Deployments don't always go smoothly. ERP integrations fail, agents don't work as expected. My approach is: be honest, explain why, fix it quickly, and over-deliver where possible. That's how I'll handle AFDA challenges."

---

### 14. "How do you handle training customers on new systems?"

**STAR Answer**:
- **Situation**: Rolled out automated reporting system at Thind Transport
- **Task**: Train team (who were resistant to change)
- **Action**: Layered approach:
  - Level 1: Why it exists (sell the benefit - saves time)
  - Level 2: How it works (walk through the process)
  - Level 3: Do it with me (hands-on guided practice)
  - Level 4: Do it yourself (I'm here for questions)
  - Created documentation (step-by-step guide with screenshots)
  - Held office hours for Q&A
- **Result**: Team adopted it quickly. Even the most skeptical member became a champion

**Connection to AFDA Role**:
> "This is core to the AFDA role. After I configure an agent, I'll train the customer's team on reviewing agent output, handling exceptions, and understanding the audit trail. I'll create documentation and be available for questions. That's the 'enablement' part of Forward Deployed."

## Gap-Owning Strategies {#gap-owning}

### Critical Gaps to Address Authentically

#### Gap 1: No CPA

**If asked**: "You don't have a CPA. How do you think about that?"

**Answer**:
> "You're right - I don't have a CPA. Here's what I do have:
>
> - **Finance degree with accounting coursework**: Managerial Accounting, Corporate Finance, Financial Modeling from UW Foster (GPA 3.6)
> - **Hands-on experience**: Month-end close support, journal entries, reconciliations, variance analysis - I've done the work at Thind Transport
> - **Understanding of accounting principles**: I know how debits and credits flow, how accruals work, how financial statements tie together
>
> The CPA would formalize what I already understand practically. I'm interested in pursuing it, and FloQast would accelerate that development by exposing me to diverse accounting workflows across customers.
>
> More importantly, for the AFDA role, the value is in the intersection of accounting knowledge and technical implementation. I understand the workflows AND I can configure automation. That hybrid skillset is what FloQast needs."

---

#### Gap 2: No Public Accounting Experience

**If asked**: "Your resume shows operations/consulting support. You didn't work in public accounting?"

**Answer** (Unwaveringly Authentic):
> "That's correct - I didn't work at a Big 4 or public accounting firm. My experience is in operations accounting at Thind Transport and financial consulting.
>
> Here's what that means:
> - I have hands-on experience with core workflows (close, reconciliations, variance) but at a smaller scale
> - I haven't prepared audited financials or worked with external auditors
> - I haven't seen the breadth of accounting systems a public accountant sees
>
> Here's what I bring that's valuable for this role:
> - **Practical experience with the exact workflows FloQast automates**: journal entries, reconciliations, close management, variance analysis
> - **Automation expertise**: I've automated financial processes (80% time savings with VBA) - that's what this role is about
> - **Customer-facing skills**: Consulting experience means I know how to discover needs, configure solutions, and train users
> - **Eagerness to learn**: I'll gain breadth by working with diverse FloQast customers across industries
>
> The AFDA role isn't about being the customer's accountant. It's about being the bridge between accounting knowledge and FloQast's technology. I have both sides of that bridge."

---

#### Gap 3: No NetSuite/Intacct Experience

**If asked**: "You don't have ERP experience with NetSuite or Intacct. How will you handle integrations?"

**Answer**:
> "You're right - I haven't worked directly with NetSuite or Intacct. But here's my parallel experience and learning approach:
>
> **Parallel experience**:
> - I have experience with Salesforce (enterprise CRM system with 2,000+ accounts)
> - I've configured integrations, automated workflows, and troubleshot data sync issues
> - The concepts are the same: API authentication, data mapping, validation, error handling
>
> **Learning approach**:
> - I'm a quick learner with technical systems. I taught myself VBA, Python, and SQL
> - I've studied the NetSuite and Intacct integration concepts in preparation for this role
> - I understand conceptually: FloQast pulls trial balance, GL detail, and transaction data via API
> - I'll work closely with customers' ERP admins (who know the ERP deeply) to configure integrations
>
> **What matters most**:
> - Understanding accounting data structures (which I do)
> - Troubleshooting mindset (which I have)
> - Collaboration with IT teams (which I've done)
>
> I won't be a NetSuite expert on day 1, but I'll become one quickly. And more importantly, I understand the accounting workflows inside those ERPs."

---

#### Gap 4: Resume Emphasizes "Hands-On" But Role Was Support-Level

**If probed**: "Your resume says 'hands-on' but it sounds like you supported the close, not owned it?"

**Answer** (Authentic & Direct):
> "That's a fair observation. Let me clarify:
>
> **What 'hands-on' meant at Thind Transport**:
> - I physically created journal entries (typed debits and credits)
> - I performed bank reconciliations (matched transactions)
> - I calculated variances and wrote explanations
> - But you're right - I didn't own the entire close process or sign off on audited financials
>
> **Why I emphasized 'hands-on'**:
> - To distinguish from purely analytical roles where you only review others' work
> - I wasn't just pulling reports - I was creating accounting deliverables
>
> **How this maps to the AFDA role**:
> - I'm not claiming to be a Controller or CPA
> - I'm claiming to understand the mechanics of these workflows because I've done them
> - That's exactly what I need to configure FloQast agents: understanding the input data, the business logic, and the desired output
>
> **Bottom line**: I have support-level experience with core accounting workflows, combined with automation expertise and customer-facing skills. That's the hybrid FloQast needs for this role."
