## 📋 Job Requirement Mapping

| FloQast AFDA Requirement | Your Salesforce Experience | How to Say It |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Configure AI workflow automation** | Built automated task creation flow; rebuilt lead-to-opportunity conversion | "I built Salesforce Flows that automated task creation and lead conversion—same logic applies to configuring FloQast AI Agents" |
| **Understand customer business processes** | Mapped broken sales workflows; identified pain points (inconsistent follow-up, manual data entry) | "I started by understanding where the sales process broke down—same approach I'd use with accounting workflows" |
| **Train customers on new workflows** | Trained sales team on automated tasks; walked CFO through dashboard | "I trained both end-users (sales reps) and executives (CFO)—different audiences, same enablement approach" |
| **Troubleshoot and debug issues** | Fixed field mapping errors, UserID passing issues, button visibility problems | "I debugged broken flows by isolating the problem (field mappings, visibility rules) and testing systematically" |
| **Ensure data quality** | Cleaned 700+ duplicate records; validated no data loss during mass merge | "I used Salesforce duplicate management to clean 700+ records while preserving all relationships and data integrity" |
| **Build dashboards and reports** | Created CFO pipeline dashboard with color-coded win rates, weekly views | "I built executive dashboards that translated raw data into actionable insights—same goal as FloQast reconciliation reports" |
| **Work independently and proactively** | Weekly backups, caught bugs before escalation, self-taught Salesforce | "I didn't wait for problems to become crises—I set up proactive maintenance and fixed issues before they escalated" |
| **Learn technical systems quickly** | Self-taught Salesforce Flow Builder using ChatGPT and Cursor; no formal training | "I had zero Salesforce training—I used AI tools, documentation, and logical troubleshooting to figure it out. Same approach I'd take with FloQast" |
| **Customer-facing communication** | Worked directly with sales team and CFO to gather requirements | "I sat down with stakeholders to understand their pain points, then built solutions that matched their needs" |
| **Document processes** | Created process documentation for lead conversion fix and workflows | "I documented everything so future troubleshooting didn't require me—same discipline I'd bring to FloQast implementations" |

## 🎯 Direct Quote Examples (Use These in Interviews)

### When they ask: "How would you configure an AI Agent for a customer?"

> "I'd approach it the same way I approached Salesforce automation. First, understand the manual process—what's the trigger, what's the action, what's the output? Then break it into steps. For example, when I built the automated task creation flow, I started by asking: When does a lead come in? What should happen next? Who needs to be notified? Then I configured the Flow to automate those steps—same logic applies to FloQast AI Agents."

---

### When they ask: "How do you troubleshoot when something isn't working?"

> "I use a systematic approach. When lead conversion was broken, I didn't panic—I mapped the expected flow, identified where it broke (field mappings, UserID passing), tested each component individually, and fixed them one by one. Then I tested edge cases to make sure it didn't break again. That same troubleshooting mindset applies to FloQast—understand the expected behavior, isolate the problem, test the fix."

---

### When they ask: "How do you ensure user adoption?"

> "I make systems simple for users. When I built the automated task flow, sales reps didn't need to understand Salesforce Flows—they just needed to see tasks appear in their queue. I trained them on what the task meant and what to do with it. Same approach I'd use with FloQast—accountants don't need to understand how the AI Agent works, they just need to trust it and know how to review exceptions."

---

### When they ask: "Tell me about a time you worked with messy data"

> "For AI-Driven Business Growth, I inherited 700+ duplicate leads and contacts. The challenge wasn't just deleting records—it was ensuring no data loss during the merge. I used Salesforce's mass merge functionality, validated that all related tasks and opportunities were preserved, then ran reports to confirm accuracy. Result: clean database, no lost data, improved reporting accuracy. That's the same discipline FloQast needs for accounting data quality."

---

### When they ask: "How do you approach learning new technical systems?"

> "I'm a self-directed learner. I had zero Salesforce training when I started this project. I used ChatGPT to understand Flow Builder concepts, used Cursor to troubleshoot syntax errors, and worked through trial and error until it worked. I'd apply the same approach to FloQast—use the documentation, leverage AI tools, ask questions, test incrementally. That's how I learn fast."

## 🧩 Salesforce Concepts → Accounting Concepts

| Salesforce Concept | Accounting Equivalent | How to Connect |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Lead → Opportunity conversion** | **AR aging → Write-off decision** | Both require field mapping, validation, and clean data flow |
| **Automated task creation** | **Variance review reminder** | Both trigger actions based on data events |
| **Duplicate cleanup** | **GL account reconciliation** | Both require matching logic and data integrity |
| **Executive dashboard** | **Close status dashboard** | Both translate raw data into decision-ready insights |
| **Field mapping** | **GL account mapping** | Both ensure data flows correctly between systems |
| **Flow testing** | **Agent testing** | Both require edge case validation before deployment |

## 💬 Conversation Starters (Use These Proactively)

### If discussing automation:
> "When I built the Salesforce task automation, I realized the key isn't just automating steps—it's understanding which steps add value and which are just noise. I'd bring that same discipline to FloQast AI Agents—automate the low-complexity, high-volume tasks so accountants can focus on judgment calls."

---

### If discussing customer-facing work:
> "One thing I learned from Salesforce consulting: users care about outcomes, not technology. Sales reps didn't care how Flows worked—they cared that follow-up became automatic. Same with accounting teams—they'll care that reconciliations are faster and more accurate, not the underlying AI. That's the mindset I'd bring to AFDA work."

---

### If discussing technical learning curve:
> "I had no Salesforce background when I started that project. By the end, I'd rebuilt flows, cleaned 700 records, and created dashboards. That's proof I can learn complex systems fast. FloQast's AI Agent platform will be the same—steep learning curve at first, but I'll get up to speed quickly."

## 🎤 The "Bridge Statement" (Use This to Connect to FloQast)

**After telling any Salesforce story, say:**

> "That experience taught me [specific lesson]. That's directly applicable to FloQast because [connection to AFDA role]."

**Examples:**

After lead conversion story:
> "That experience taught me how to rebuild broken workflows from scratch. That's directly applicable to FloQast because I'll be configuring AI Agents for accounting workflows—same problem-solving approach, different domain."

After data cleanup story:
> "That experience taught me how to manage messy data without losing critical information. That's directly applicable to FloQast because data quality is everything in accounting—bad data in means bad reconciliations out."

After CFO dashboard story:
> "That experience taught me how to communicate with executives through data visualization. That's directly applicable to FloQast because I'll need to show customers how AI Agents improve close efficiency—dashboards and metrics matter."

You didn't just "use" Salesforce.  
You **transformed** a broken system.

You didn't just "configure" automation.  
You **rebuilt workflows** from scratch.

You didn't just "clean" data.  
You **rescued** 700 records without data loss.

You didn't just "create" a dashboard.  
You **empowered** the CFO with real-time insights.

**That's not junior-level work. That's Forward Deployed Accountant work.**
