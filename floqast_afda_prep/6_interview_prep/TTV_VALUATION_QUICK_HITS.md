## 🎯 The 30-Second Pitch

"I led a business valuation for a Seattle retail company. Analyzed four years of financials—P&L, Balance Sheet, financial ratios. Normalized EBITDA by adjusting for below-market owner salary, below-market rent, and employee compensation. Applied industry multiples to calculate a $1.45 million to $1.75 million valuation range. Delivered a 46-page investor-ready report. The owner used it for investment discussions. That's the same discipline I'd bring to FloQast—structured analysis, clear documentation, and explaining complex financial concepts to stakeholders."
