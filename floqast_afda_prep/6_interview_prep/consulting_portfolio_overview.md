## 🎤 Portfolio Narrative (60 seconds)

"Since graduating from UW Foster in June 2024, I've built a consulting practice focused on financial analysis and system automation. For Tabletop Village, I led a comprehensive business valuation—analyzed four years of financials, normalized EBITDA, and delivered a 46-page investor-ready report valued at $1.45 to $1.75 million. For AI-Driven Business Growth, I transformed a broken Salesforce instance—rebuilt the lead conversion flow, cleaned 700 duplicate records, automated task creation, and built executive dashboards. The result: 95% conversion rate, zero manual tasks, real-time reporting. Both projects required the same discipline: structured analysis, clear documentation, and communicating complex concepts to stakeholders. That's exactly what FloQast AFDAs do—deploy automation for accounting teams with rigorous methodology and customer-first communication."
