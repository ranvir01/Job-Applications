## 📖 The Narrative (How to Tell the Story)

"I led a comprehensive business valuation for a Seattle-based retail company with after-school programs. The owner needed a credible valuation for potential investor discussions. I analyzed four years of financial statements—P&L, Balance Sheet, financial ratios—then benchmarked against industry standards. The tricky part was EBITDA adjustments: the owner's salary was below market, rent was below market, and there were employee costs that needed normalizing to reflect true earning power. I built an EBITDA multiple valuation model, calculated a range of $1.45 million to $1.75 million, and delivered a 46-page professional report with full methodology, appendices, and supporting data. The owner used it for investor conversations. No finance transformation software—just structured analysis, Excel modeling, and clear communication of complex financial concepts to a non-finance stakeholder."

## ⭐ STAR Stories for Interviews

### Story 1: Financial Statement Deep Dive (Accounting Workflows & Analysis)

**Situation**  
The owner of Tabletop Village, a Seattle retail business with after-school programs, needed a credible business valuation to discuss potential investment or sale opportunities. He had four years of financial data but no formal analysis of what the business was actually worth.

**Task**  
My job was to analyze four years of financial statements (2020-2024), assess the company's financial health, and determine an appropriate valuation range that could withstand investor scrutiny.

**Action**  
1. **Financial Statement Review**: I reviewed the full P&L and Balance Sheet for 2020-2023, plus partial 2024 data. I calculated year-over-year percent changes to identify trends in revenue, COGS, gross profit, and net income.

2. **Variance Analysis**: I performed variance analysis across all four years:
   - Revenue grew from $59,851 (2020) to $1,303,643 (2023)—a 2,078% increase over four years
   - Identified COGS volatility (fluctuating between 84% and 75% of revenue)
   - Tracked operating expenses and owner compensation trends

3. **Financial Ratio Calculation**: I calculated key financial ratios:
   - Current Ratio (liquidity assessment)
   - Debt-to-Equity Ratio (leverage analysis)
   - Gross Margin and Net Margin (profitability)
   - Compared each ratio to industry benchmarks for retail and after-school programs

4. **Industry Benchmarking**: I compared Tabletop Village's ratios to industry averages to validate whether the business was performing above, at, or below market.

**Result**  
The financial analysis determined that Tabletop Village was "financially healthy and increasing"—key language that supported the upper end of the valuation range ($1.75M). The structured analysis gave the owner confidence in the numbers and provided investors with the rigor they expected.

### Story 2: EBITDA Adjustments (Process Decomposition & Normalization)

**Situation**  
The raw net income from Tabletop Village's financials didn't reflect the true earning power of the business. The owner was paying himself below market salary, rent was below market rate, and there were employee compensation items that needed normalization to show what a new owner would actually experience.

**Task**  
Normalize EBITDA by identifying and adjusting for non-recurring, non-market, and owner-specific expenses so the valuation reflected true business value.

**Action**  
1. **Identified Adjustment Categories**:
   - **Interest on Long-term Debt**: Added back to EBITDA (varies by year: $782 to $18,942)
   - **Rent Normalization**: Owner paid $26,200/year; market rate was $47,160/year for comparable Seattle retail space
   - **Owner Salary Normalization**: Historical salary of $60,000/year; normalized to market rate of $105,000/year
   - **Manager Salary Adjustments**: Normalized manager and employee salaries to industry standards

2. **Built Adjustment Model**: Created a structured spreadsheet that:
   - Took net income as the base
   - Added back interest expense
   - Replaced historical rent with normalized rent
   - Replaced historical owner salary with normalized owner salary
   - Applied employee salary normalization

3. **Calculated Adjusted EBITDA**: Applied adjustments across all years to show the trend in normalized earnings. For projected 2024, adjusted EBITDA came to ~$189,000-$244,000 depending on adjustment methodology.

4. **Documented Methodology**: Included full appendix showing each adjustment with explanation so investors could follow the logic.

**Result**  
The EBITDA adjustments transformed raw financials into an accurate picture of earning power. Instead of relying on inconsistent net income figures, the valuation was based on normalized, repeatable earnings. This is the same discipline used in month-end close (normalizing accruals, adjustments) and variance analysis (explaining differences from budget).

### Story 3: Professional Deliverable for Stakeholders (Documentation & Communication)

**Situation**  
The business owner needed more than a spreadsheet—he needed a polished, investor-ready document that he could share with potential buyers or investors. The valuation had to be credible, well-organized, and explain complex financial concepts to non-finance audiences.

**Task**  
Create a comprehensive valuation report that could serve as a standalone document for investor discussions.

**Action**  
1. **Structured the Report**:
   - **Executive Summary**: High-level valuation range ($1.45M-$1.75M) with key findings
   - **Business Overview**: Company description, products/services, organizational structure
   - **Financial Analysis Section**: Methodology, statement analysis, industry analysis
   - **Valuation Analysis Section**: EBITDA multiples approach, industry comparisons, adjustments
   - **Appendices**: Full P&L, Balance Sheet, financial ratios, EBITDA adjustment details, rent analysis

2. **Explained Methodology Clearly**: Wrote each section so a non-finance reader could understand:
   - Why we used EBITDA multiples (not DCF or comparables—due to limited operating history)
   - How adjustments were calculated and why they mattered
   - What the valuation range meant and how to interpret it

3. **Included Visual Aids**: Added tables, organizational charts, and structured appendices to make the document scannable and professional.

4. **Quality Review**: Ensured consistency in formatting, calculations, and narrative throughout all 46+ pages.

**Result**  
Delivered a professional 46-page valuation report that the owner used for investor conversations. The document was comprehensive enough to stand on its own and clear enough for non-finance stakeholders to understand. This is the same documentation discipline FloQast AFDAs need when training customers and creating implementation materials.

### Story 4: Industry Analysis & Value Drivers (Benchmarking & Insights)

**Situation**  
To apply appropriate EBITDA multiples, I needed to understand where Tabletop Village fit in the industry landscape and what factors would drive or limit its value.

**Task**  
Conduct industry analysis to determine appropriate EBITDA multiple range and identify value drivers and limiters.

**Action**  
1. **Industry Multiple Research**: Researched EBITDA multiples for:
   - Retail Special Lines (specialty retail): 2.5-4.5x for $100K-$500K EBITDA
   - After-School Programs: 3-5x for similar EBITDA ranges
   - Selected 3-5x range as appropriate given hybrid business model

2. **Value Driver Assessment**:
   - **Positive Drivers**:
     - Pokémon industry experiencing growth
     - First-mover advantage in after-school programming
     - Diverse customer base (low concentration risk)
     - Diversified suppliers (low supply risk)
     - Low key-owner risk (owner minimally involved in day-to-day)
     - Increasing historical performance
     - Minimal local competition
   
   - **Value Limiters**:
     - Need to relocate in 1.5 years (cost of growth)
     - Inconsistent profitability in historical periods
     - No valuable intellectual property
     - Relatively short operating history (4-5 years)
     - Cyclical business nature

3. **Applied Multiple to Adjusted EBITDA**: Used the 3-5x range against normalized EBITDA to calculate valuation range.

**Result**  
The industry analysis justified the $1.45M-$1.75M valuation range. Because the financial analysis showed "healthy and increasing" performance, I recommended the owner position toward the $1.75M end when negotiating. The value driver assessment gave the owner talking points for investor discussions.
