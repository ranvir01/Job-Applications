## 🎯 The 30-Second Pitch

"I consulted for a business with a broken Salesforce instance. Lead conversion wasn't working, data was full of duplicates, follow-up was inconsistent. I rebuilt the lead-to-opportunity flow, cleaned 700+ duplicate records, automated task creation so every lead got instant follow-up, and built dashboards for the CFO. Result: 95% conversion rate, zero manual tasks, real-time reporting. No dev background—just logic, AI tools, and refusing to accept 'that's how it works.'"

## 🎤 Power Phrases (Use These Verbatim)

### On Problem-Solving
> "I came in, saw a Salesforce that was slow and full of noise. Lead conversion was broken—description field disappeared, UserID wasn't passed, button didn't even show. I rebuilt the flow from scratch."

### On Automation
> "Every time a lead pops in, boom—a task shows up for the rep: send intro email, pre-filled with the lead name. No more excuses."

### On Data Quality
> "Removed 700 duplicates using mass merge. Now the CFO can actually trust the pipeline numbers."

### On Self-Learning
> "No dev background—just logic, curiosity, and not accepting 'that's how it works.'"

### On User Adoption
> "I don't make things complex for users. Sales reps didn't need to understand flows—they just needed tasks to appear."
