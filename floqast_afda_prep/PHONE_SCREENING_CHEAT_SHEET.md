## Your 60-Second Pitch

**"Tell me about yourself"** (Practice this until it flows naturally)

> "I'm Ranvir Thind, a Finance grad from UW Foster with 4 years of hands-on accounting and consulting experience. At Thind Transport, I supported month-end close, did journal entries, reconciliations, and variance analysis. I also automated our financial reporting with VBA, cutting reporting time by 80%.
>
> More recently, I've been consulting, where I rebuilt a client's Salesforce system from scratch, cleaned 700 duplicate records, and delivered a $1.5 million business valuation with a 46-page investor report.
>
> I use AI tools like ChatGPT and Cursor daily for financial modeling. What excites me about FloQast is the chance to combine my accounting knowledge with automation, working directly with customers to deploy AI Agents."

**Time: 45-60 seconds. Don't go longer.**

## Questions They WILL Ask

### Why FloQast?

> "Three reasons: First, FloQast is at the intersection of accounting and AI, which is exactly where I want to build my career. Second, I love that it was built by accountants for accountants. That authenticity shows in the product. Third, the AFDA role is unique. It's customer-facing, technical, and uses my accounting background. That combination is rare."

### Why this role specifically?

> "I love the idea of being Forward Deployed. Instead of sitting in an office, I'd be embedded with customers, understanding their workflows, configuring solutions, and training their teams. That's the consulting experience I enjoy, but with a product I believe in and a company backing me up."

### What's your accounting/close experience?

> "At Thind Transport, I supported month-end close for 4 years. That included preparing journal entries, bank reconciliations, and variance analysis. I also did detailed financial statement analysis for a business valuation, reviewing 4 years of P&L and Balance Sheet data. I understand the workflows FloQast automates because I've done them manually."

### What's your automation experience?

> "Two main examples: First, I automated financial reporting at Thind Transport using Excel VBA. Cut reporting time from 8 hours to 1.5 hours, an 80% reduction. Second, I rebuilt a client's broken Salesforce system. Fixed the lead conversion flow, cleaned 700 duplicate records, and built automated task creation. I use ChatGPT and Cursor daily for financial modeling."

### Why are you looking to leave consulting?

> "I enjoy consulting, but I want to go deeper with one product and one team. With consulting, every project ends and you move on. At FloQast, I'd build expertise, see customers succeed long-term, and contribute to improving the product. That continuity is appealing."

## Salary Discussion

**Posted range: $76,000 - $114,000 + bonus**

**If they ask first:**
> "I've seen the posted range of $76K to $114K. Based on my experience with accounting workflows, automation, and customer-facing work, I'd be targeting the mid-to-upper end of that range. But I'm flexible and more interested in the role fit. What range are you working with for this position?"

**If they push for a specific number:**
> "I'm targeting $90K to $100K base, plus the bonus component. I'm open to discussing based on the full package."

**Key points:**
- Don't give a number first if you can avoid it
- Reference the posted range (shows you did research)
- "Mid-to-upper" positions you without overreaching
- Always mention you're flexible and focused on fit

## Your Numbers (Drop these naturally)

| Metric | Story |
|--------|-------|
| **80% time savings** | VBA automation at Thind Transport |
| **95% conversion rate** | Fixed Salesforce lead-to-opportunity flow |
| **700+ duplicates cleaned** | Salesforce data quality project |

## Gap Responses (Keep Brief)

**"You don't have a CPA?"**
> "That's right. I have a Finance degree with accounting coursework from UW Foster, plus 4 years of hands-on accounting work. The CPA is something I'm interested in pursuing, and FloQast would accelerate that development."

**"No public accounting experience?"**
> "Correct. My experience is in operations accounting and consulting. I've done the core workflows, journal entries, reconciliations, variance analysis, just at a smaller scale. The AFDA role is about bridging accounting knowledge and technology, which is where I add value."

**"No NetSuite/Intacct experience?"**
> "Not directly, but I have Salesforce experience with similar concepts: API integrations, workflow configuration, troubleshooting. I'm a quick learner. I taught myself VBA, Python, and SQL. I'd work with customers' ERP admins and get up to speed quickly."

## Questions for the Recruiter (Pick 2-3)

These are appropriate for a recruiter (save technical questions for hiring manager):

1. **"What does the interview process look like after this call?"**
   - Shows you're thinking ahead

2. **"How large is the AFDA team currently, and how is it growing?"**
   - Shows interest in the team

3. **"What's the timeline for filling this role?"**
   - Practical, shows you're serious

4. **"What qualities do successful AFDAs at FloQast share?"**
   - Gets insight into what they value

5. **"What's the company culture like? I saw FloQast has won Best Workplace awards."**
   - Shows you did research

**Don't ask:**
- Deep technical questions about AI Agents (recruiter won't know)
- Questions about specific customer deployments
- Anything you could easily Google

---

## Tone and Energy Reminders

**Screening = Personality Check**

The recruiter is asking: "Do I want to pass this person to the hiring manager?"

- **Be warm and conversational**, not robotic or rehearsed
- **Show genuine enthusiasm** for FloQast (they can tell if you're faking)
- **Keep answers under 90 seconds** (recruiters screen many candidates)
- **Listen and respond**, don't just recite prepared answers
- **Smile while talking** (it changes your voice)

**Power phrases to use:**
- "What excites me about this is..."
- "That's exactly the kind of work I enjoy..."
- "I've actually done something similar when I..."

## Red Flags to Avoid

| Ask about salary first | Let them bring it up |
