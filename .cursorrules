# Cursor Rules for Job Applications Workspace

## Resume Creation

When the user requests a resume for a job (any phrasing like "create resume", "make resume", "tailor resume", "apply for this job", etc.) with a job description:

1. **ALWAYS read and follow**: `/workspace/RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. **ALWAYS read framing guidelines**: `/workspace/resumes/README.md` (Universal Resume Writing Principles section)
3. **ALWAYS use as source**: `/workspace/resumes/master-resume.md`

Execute the full automated process in RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md without asking clarifying questions.

## Key Framing Rules (Quick Reference)

- Frame AI usage as augmentation with human ownership
- Lead bullets with business outcomes, not tool names
- Describe scale by complexity/techniques, not row counts
- Show stakeholder adaptability and changing requirements
- Walk through decisions with questions and outcomes
- Avoid red flag phrases (see README.md for full list)

## File Organization

- Master resume source: `/workspace/resumes/master-resume.md`
- Application-specific files: `/workspace/applications/[company-name]/`
- Always generate PDF using: `npx md-to-pdf [file.md]`
- Update tracker: `/workspace/tracker.md`

## Output Requirements

For each job application, create:
1. `applications/[company]/job-description.md` - saved JD
2. `applications/[company]/resume.md` - tailored resume
3. `applications/[company]/resume.pdf` - PDF version
4. Update `tracker.md` with new entry
