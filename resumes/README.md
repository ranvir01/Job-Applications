## Universal Resume Writing Principles (Framing Experience Authentically)

> **AI AGENTS & USERS**: These principles apply to ALL resumes regardless of role type. Following these guidelines ensures the resume communicates genuine competence rather than raising red flags for hiring managers.

### 1. Own Your Work with AI/Tools

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Used ChatGPT/AI to automate everything" | "Used AI to accelerate routine work while reviewing, testing, and owning final deliverables" |

**Why**: Hiring managers want to see you can explain, debug, and defend your own work. AI is a tool, not a replacement for your judgment.

**Resume Application**: When mentioning AI tools, always pair with ownership language: "Used AI (Cursor, OpenAI) to rapidly prototype solutions, validating outputs through testing before deployment"

---

### 2. Demonstrate Adaptability with Stakeholders

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Successfully delivered project on time" (implying perfect conditions) | "Confirmed assumptions early and adapted to evolving requirements to keep work on track" |

**Why**: Real work involves changing requirements. Claiming perfect conditions signals inexperience with actual stakeholder dynamics.

**Resume Application**: Include language showing flexibility: "Collaborated with stakeholders to refine scope as business priorities evolved" or "Adjusted forecasting models based on leadership feedback"

---

### 3. Frame Scale Meaningfully (Not Just Numbers)

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Worked with big datasets: 10,000+ rows" | "Worked with datasets requiring filtering, aggregation, and performance optimization" |

**Why**: Raw row counts can sound naive. Focus on the complexity and techniques required, showing you understand what scale actually means.

**Resume Application**: Describe what made the data challenging, not just size: "Processed multi-source datasets requiring deduplication, aggregation, and validation across business units"

---

### 4. Business Question First, Tools Second

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Proficient in SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel" (tool-focused) | "Focus on understanding business questions first, then select tools that best support the analysis" |

**Why**: Listing tools suggests you think analytics = software. Employers want insight generators, not button-pushers.

**Resume Application**: Lead with the business outcome: "Built executive dashboards synthesizing KPIs to inform quarterly planning" instead of "Created Tableau dashboards"

---

### 5. Show Current, Practical Tool Usage

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Advanced Excel: VLOOKUP, pivot tables, macros" | "Use Excel for exploratory analysis, validation, and quick data review" |

**Why**: Citing specific "advanced" functions (especially older ones like VLOOKUP) signals your skills stopped evolving. Modern analysts use Excel as one tool among many.

**Resume Application**: Frame tools by purpose, not features: "Built automated reporting using Excel VBA, reducing manual processing 80%" shows impact, not just skill listing.

---

### 6. Connect Technical Work to Business Understanding

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Strong technical skills applicable to any industry" | "Spend time understanding how the business works so analysis answers the right questions" |

**Why**: "Any industry" sounds like you produce outputs without understanding context. Employers want insights tailored to their business.

**Resume Application**: Show domain connection: "Developed forecasting models aligned with logistics operations, improving fleet utilization" demonstrates business understanding.

---

### 7. Demonstrate Ramp-Up Ability with Examples

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Quick learner who will figure it out on the job" | "Confident in ability to ramp up quickly based on track record of approaching new domains" |

**Why**: Asking for a chance puts risk on the employer. Showing past examples of quick adaptation proves capability.

**Resume Application**: Include evidence: "Rapidly learned Salesforce CRM to automate 2,000+ client accounts within first month" proves ramp-up speed.

---

### 8. Apply Training, Don't Just List It

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Completed Google Data Analytics Certificate" | "Formal training provided foundation; applied storytelling skills to explain analysis to non-technical audiences" |

**Why**: Leaning on certificates signals coursework-based confidence. Show how you applied what you learned.

**Resume Application**: Connect training to application: "Applied financial modeling coursework to deliver $1.45M-$1.75M business valuation for client"

---

### 9. Walk Through Decisions and Outcomes

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Completed project solving real business problems" | "Worked on project supporting a specific decision; here's the question addressed and what changed as a result" |

**Why**: Generic claims about "real problems" sound memorized. Employers want to see you can walk through actual decision processes.

**Resume Application**: Be specific: "Built DCF model to evaluate $1.737M property acquisition; analysis informed negotiation strategy and projected IRR scenarios"

---

### 10. Show Thoughtful Data Work (Tradeoffs, Not Just Cleaning)

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Cleaned data by removing duplicates and outliers" | "Evaluated duplicates, missing values, and outliers; documented tradeoffs before making changes" |

**Why**: Claiming you "removed" issues sounds like you deleted inconvenient data. Show analytical judgment.

**Resume Application**: Demonstrate evaluation: "Designed data validation process identifying discrepancies across sources, documenting business rules for handling exceptions"

---

## Quick Reference: Red Flag Phrases to Avoid

These phrases (common in resumes and interviews) often raise concerns:

| Red Flag Phrase | What Hiring Managers Hear |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "I use AI/ChatGPT for everything" | Can't explain or defend their own work |
| "Never had requirements change" | Never worked with real stakeholders |
| "Worked with 10,000+ rows" | Doesn't understand what scale means |
| "I can learn any tool" | Thinks analytics = software, not insight |
| "Advanced Excel: VLOOKUP" | Skills stopped evolving years ago |
| "I'll work in any industry" | Produces outputs, not business insights |
| "Just need a chance" | Asking employer to take all the risk |
| "Took [Certificate], covered it well" | Confidence based on coursework, not experience |
| "Solved real business problems" | Memorized phrase, can't walk through decisions |
| "Cleaned data, no outliers left" | Deleted inconvenient data without judgment |
