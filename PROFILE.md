## ✍️ Writing Style & Voice

> **For AI Agents**: This section captures how Ranvir communicates. Match this tone in all written materials.

### Ranvir's Voice Characteristics

| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | Gets to the point, no fluff | "I drove 15-20% returns" not "I was instrumental in facilitating improved outcomes" |
| **Confident** | States achievements clearly | "Built dashboards that cut time 80%" not "Helped contribute to time savings" |
| **Results-focused** | Always ties to outcomes | Every bullet has a number or clear impact |
| **Technical but accessible** | Knows the jargon but explains clearly | Uses terms like DCF, EBITDA naturally |
| **Practical** | Shows real-world application | References actual clients, real projects |

### Phrases Ranvir DOES Use
- "I drove..." / "I built..." / "I led..."
- "...resulting in X% improvement"
- "data-driven" (genuinely, not as buzzword)
- "cross-functional" (when actually working across teams)
- Direct statements of what he did and the result

### Phrases to AVOID (Sound Too AI)
- ❌ "I am passionate about..."
- ❌ "Leverage synergies"
- ❌ "Excited to bring my expertise..."
- ❌ "Spearheaded transformational initiatives"
- ❌ "Holistic approach"
- ❌ "Dynamic environment"
- ❌ "Proven track record of excellence"
- ❌ Starting every sentence with "I"
- ❌ Overly formal or robotic phrasing
- ❌ Em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) anywhere
- ❌ "Actionable insights" without specifics
- ❌ "Successfully" or "Effectively" starting bullets

### Sample Voice (From Original Resume)
> "I am eager to bring my experience in financial planning and analysis to innovative teams, driving growth through data-driven insights."

This is good because it's:
- Personal ("I am eager")
- Specific ("financial planning and analysis")
- Action-oriented ("driving growth")
- Grounded ("data-driven insights")

### Rewriting Examples

| ❌ AI-Sounding | ✅ Ranvir's Voice |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Leveraged analytical capabilities to optimize financial outcomes" | "Used financial modeling to drive 15 to 20% returns" |
| "Passionate about utilizing cutting-edge technologies" | "I use SQL, Python, and VBA to automate analysis" |
| "Demonstrated excellence in stakeholder management" | "Presented valuation insights to executives" |
| "Seeking to leverage my diverse skill set" | "I want to bring my FP&A experience to your team" |
| "$1.45M–$1.75M valuation" (has dashes) | "$1.45M to $1.75M valuation" (no dashes) |
| "June 2024 – Present" (has dashes) | "June 2024 to Present" (no dashes) |
