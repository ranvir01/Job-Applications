> **Instructions**: Customize for each application. The structure below follows best practices.

## ⚠️ Writing Style Reminder

**Write like Ranvir, not like AI.**

- Be direct and confident, not stiff or overly formal
- Use specific numbers and real examples
- Avoid: "passionate about," "leverage synergies," "excited to utilize"
- Good: "I drove...", "I built...", "I want to bring..."
- Read it out loud – if it sounds robotic, rewrite it
